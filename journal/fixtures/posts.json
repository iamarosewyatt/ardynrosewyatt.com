An undercurrent of calm and a sense of breadth open up inside my chest. Perception is affected. I&rsquo;m able to imagine Al and me, both of us happily engaged in our concerns. I can see him in his uniqueness, behind his desk or coming out of the shower, and warmth for him fills me. <strong>I have space in my world for what he is, without judgment, without an urge to correct or adjust. The reflex to assume a contrasting position simply doesn&rsquo;t happen. </strong>We are two fish, swimming in a very large ocean, both at home, both sustained, buoyant in the water. His activity may affect the water that surrounds me, cause movement my way, only a nudge. I am assured. There is no fear that the ocean will suddenly dry up. The water is there for me, regardless.</p><p>When <a href=\"/real-life/\">Al </a>stopped insisting one of us had to be wrong. When he didn&rsquo;t have to talk so much, bring me into line with his point of view, when the idea of controlling the outcome became obviously ludicrous, love had a chance.</p><p>I see him more clearly than ever, sense myself more powerfully &ndash; bare naked awareness &ndash; without the urge to censor, no audience, no need to create an impression. Within the context of acceptance I can see us more truly and distinctively ourselves, loving both of us with an appreciation that enlivens me.\"</p>",

But, I'd <a href=\"/journal/2014/03/03/it-changed-everything/\">left my life behind</a>, and before I could move forward again, I needed to 'pull myself together'. Writing seemed the best way to do that. I had a record, had been diligent about keeping my journal, and now I could use it - bring all the <a href=\"/journal/2014/03/15/reference-points/\">reference points</a> together in one place. I called it \"writing (righting) myself\".</p><p>What began as an exercise in clarity became a labor of love. When people asked how my story was coming along, I'd say \"I'm falling in love with myself.\" It was true. From the vantage point of just-enough-time-and-distance, I could appreciate the 'me' I had been through the years. My heart, and sometimes my eyes, filled to overflowing for the woman I saw myself becoming through the events in my journal- a journey of self love.</p><p>Writing has now become one of the activities I use to express my true nature. With it, I look for my soft spots, my personal impressions and experiences that demand my vulnerability and honesty. When I'm fully engaged and competely focused on my intent to create something of beauty, I feel free. That's where I want to be.</p><p>From the back cover of my book...</p><p>\"Why did I come?

Next, I decided my state of being through radar-like detection of feedback from my boyfriend, friends, family, boss - if they were happy with me, then I figured I was alright.

      "content": "<p><strong>\"What's it like to be a twin?\"</strong> I heard it all the time growing up and I always had the same response - \"I don't know. I've never been anything else.\" And it was true. Being a twin was so much a part of me, it was impossible for me to look at it objectively. As I've grown, I've nurtured a 'witness' stance, allowing me to see myself, and my life, from a gentle distance. Some of the things I've noticed during this process of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation\">individuation</a>have a lot to do with \"remembering our beauty\".</p><p><strong>My twin sister, Kath, and I were connected, and this sense of connection was very real to both of us.</strong> We often knew what the other was thinking, could finish each other's sentences, and couldn't stand to be disloyal to each other or see the other hurt. Ironically, we were born into <strong>a family that encouraged competition as the means of establishing one's position and value.</strong> There were seven children, the first six born within six years, and you can believe the competition for attention and identity was intense.</p><p>Along with that, Kathryn and I were subject to ongoing, personal scrutiny as people often approached us to evaluate our personalities and features in order to \"tell us apart\". <strong>The experience of being compared </strong>to her to determine who was \"smarter\" and who was \"prettier\" was etched into my psyche.</p><p>At some level, I realized that if I 'won' in these impromptu competitions it hurt Kath, since the only means she had to feel secure in her identity was to be 'right' <em>in comparison to </em>my 'wrong'. <strong>I learned that expressing my uniqueness was a threat to another, and rather than hurt Kathryn, I bowed out of the competition and became silent.</strong></p><p>For most of my life, I lived in the pain of denying my Truth. The process of 'remembering my beauty' has been the process of expanding the context of my awareness to be large enough to include both Kathryn and me in our unique beauty.</p><p><strong>I couldn't hurt Kath, but, at some point, I couldn't deny myself either, so expanding the context was the only option.</strong> This meant stepping back from the obvious, assuming a 'witness' stance, and going into my heart-of-hearts, over and over again, to bring Love, Love big enough for the both of us, to the foreground. <strong>It's meant <em>willfully</em> cultivating the intention \"Love wins\"</strong>.</p><p>The intent to find a place that included Kath and me together, and the consistent practice of attending to the Love I had for my sister, has expanded my awareness. Now I know,<strong><em>there is room enough for all of us to shine.</em></strong>A person doesn't need to judge themself \"better\" than another in order to experience themself as \"good\". We are <em>all</em> innately worthy and can experience \"Love that includes\" within the comfort of our own skin.</p><p>It's like <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6900.Tuesdays_With_Morrie\">Morrie </a>said, \"Love wins. Love always wins.\"</p><p>Remember the beauty that you are....</p>",

According to <span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Positive-Psychology-C-Snyder/dp/0195135334\">The Handbook of Positive Psychology</a></span>, <em>flow</em> has the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>intense and focused concentration on what one is doing in the present moment</li><li>merging of action and awareness</li><li>loss of awareness of oneself as a social actor</li><li>a sense that one can control their actions within the situation</li><li>a sense that time has passed faster than normal</li><li>experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding</li></ul><p>Sounds like a great place, and it is. So I ask again, why don't we go there more often?</p><p>Well, for one thing, getting into the state of flow means finding an \"intrinscally fragile\" balance. <strong>If the activity is too challenging, we become anxious, if the activity isn't challenging enough, we get bored. Flow is a state of \"optimal arousal\".</strong> (Hmm, there it is again)</p><p>And it doesn't come with just any challenging activity.<strong> It seems to be associated with activites we do <em>for pure enjoyment; </em>painting, chess, aethsetic experience, sports or writing. </strong>(I think I'd include <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/ardynrwyatt/\">Pinterest</a> on this list). When we are fully focused on a challenge we feel confident we can meet, and the activity is one we enjoy, we get in the <em>flow</em>. This is the state I'm in every time I write one of these posts. I'm in search of 'right expression', listening, and everything else falls aways.</p><p>I'm talking about it, actually I'm advocating for it, because flow is the state we're looking for when we want to be creative.It's no accident that the concept was first studied after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi\">Csikszentmihalyi </a>noticed that \"when work on a painting was going well, the artist persisted single-mindedly, disregarding hunger, fatigue and discomfort.\"It's the Alpha state.<strong> It's the place where inspiration and new ideas are born. That's where we want to be.</strong></p><p>Create options not being offered.</p>",

Will it improve on the silence?\" What he has offered are filters with which to discern and judge what we dispense. <strong>Given the ever-enlarging conversation, I'm proposing we learn to apply similar filters to the information we are willing to take in.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/center-for-critical-thinking/401\">The Center for Critical Thinking and Moral Critique</a></strong> conducts advanced research on critical thinking and has established <a href=\"http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/universal-intellectual-standards/527\"><strong>Universal Intellectual Standards</strong> </a>to guide learners. They list seven standards to be applied to our thought processes when we're concerned about the quality of our reasoning, but, for the purpose of choosing what information to assimilate, three standards seem applicable and pertinent.</p><ol><li><strong>Is it clear?</strong> (true) This is the entry criteria. If the information isn't clear, I can't decide if it's relevant or fair. I want it simplified when possible - I don't want to work harder than is absolutely necessary. There's a lot vying for my attention.</li><li><strong>Is it relevant?</strong> (necessary) This can depend on where I'm headed and what I want to accomplish. It will change according to my agenda at the time. It's my job to keep this criteria in the front of my mind as I scan information.</li><li><strong>Is it fair?</strong> (kind) It's human nature to present information according to our personal biases, but I prefer to read and watch material offered from a balanced and thoughtful perspective. As a consumer, I'd rather not have to sift through someone else's unfinished business.</li></ol><p>I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the standards that most appeal to me can easily be paired with three of Sai Baba's prompts, and I can whole-heartedly echo, \"Is it an improvement over silence?\" <strong>In a world of stimulation and distraction, silence might be the ultimate competition.</strong></p><p>There are any number of standards to choose from and which standards we adopt is a personal preference. And, just in case you're wondering, the three standards I apply to the information I take in are the same three I use when writing my posts. I hope it makes for enjoyable reading. :-)</p>",

But, there's a second admonition in that prayer, \"...to change the things we can...\" Let's talk about what we might feel the urge to change in the face of a 13 ft. wall of ocean.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/50/\">The Huffington Post</a> asked readers about survival strategies and their plans for finding comfort during Hurricane Sandy's rampage. The list included stocking up on essentials, eating comfort foods (including homemade soup), snuggling pets, reading, not answering the phone, and adhering to established routines. Once safety was assured, coping tactics seemed to arrange themselves neatly around one core impulse - the instinct to draw in to ourselves - closer to home.</p><p><strong>When life is predictable and our equilibrium is not at stake, we can be careless.</strong> Self awareness and self monitoring loosen, and we tend to live our lives slightly beyond ourselves, in innocent and subtle preoccupation.</p><p>When the status quo is called into question we <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/11/the-big-picture/\">make adjustments</a>. We tend to focus more on the immediate, we pay closer attention and become more present. This isn't a panic response. <strong>This is deliberately tuning in, applying ourselves to the moment at hand.</strong></p><p>This perspective is scalable, accurate. It isn't characterized by big statements, lofty ideas and clever posturing. It's more closely akin to simple motives, obvious explanations and true words, a return to what is essential and intrinsically valuable.</p><p>Just like the storm-tracking radar that warned us of Sandy's potential well before she ever made landfall, those of us who've been-there-and-back a few times can exploit our experience and anticipate the life 'storms' that inevitably arise. That's one of the perks of having a few grey hairs - we don't have to wait until the windows are rattling and the waves are crashing before we make adjustments and <strong>live 'closer to home'.</strong></p>",

As I've clarified my intentions and initiated my business plan, there have been some personal challenges arise within my family.

I hold onto the truth, focus on my good intentions. \"I know what's in my heart\" is my mantra.</p><p><strong>I am so grateful for my memories of Love.</strong></p><p>Secondly, and closely related to the first, I'm grateful to those who have gone before me and have shared their challenges, insights and Love. I'm talking about masters, like Christ and Buddha, but Im also talking about the wise men and women whose words and books inspire and uplift me; Carl Jung, Mother Meera, Joseph Campbell, Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Neil Donald Walsh, Pema Chodron, John Kabot Zinn, Carolyn Myss, Eckhart Tolle, Gary Zukav, Martha Beck, Eben Alexander, too many more to mention.</p><p><strong>Where would we be without seekers and teachers, those willing to explore and experience new ways of being, leaving landmarks for others to follow? </strong>So many times, when I've felt alone and forgotten, the gracious words of these 'friends' have comforted and soothed my soul.

His teachings were meant to </span><em>enable</em><span>us toward that goal - to open our eyes to the Truth about ourselves.</span>Christ saw us through eyes of Love, not eyes that saw our imperfections and suffering.<strong>He did not see us as victims, but as sons and daughters of the Father - Divine Source.</strong><a href=\"http://www.tm.org/blog/enlightenment/kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/\">\"...the kingdom of God is within you.\" Luke 17:21</a></p><p><span><span>I think there's a misunderstanding about compassion. It seems that compassion has come to mean \"With an open heart, focus on, and identify with, the confusion and suffering of others.\" The way it was taught to me, if I didn't join the other in their suffering, I wasn't being compassionate. <strong>Christ's teaching to &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; was not an admonition to abandon our well-being for the sake of another, but a call to remember the truth about the Love we are. From that awareness of </strong></span><strong><em>powerful </em>Love, we are able to see clearly the needs <em>and the beauty</em>in the other, and respond in the most loving way.</strong></span></p><p>Many of those who espouse and preach Christianity use it as a tool to judge and control others. Christ's<span>words have been taught from pulpits raised above. This is the perspective created by systems assuming and misusing power - that they know better, and that we, the confused, suffering and imperfect, require their intervention to find our way. This is a lie. <strong>We already have the Love of which Christ spoke.</strong></span></p><p><span><span><strong>To know this Love, what's needed is for us to move beyond the beliefs that impede that knowing, including beliefs that cause our suffering, and those imposed by those in power.</strong> This is not easy - \"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.\" - but the expereince of</span><em>powerful</em><span>Love is available to each us.</span></span></p><p><strong><span>HUMILITY = accurate perception. Love is a very horizontal experience, no-one is above another.</span></strong><span>Knowing Love finds us in the correct relationship to Source. You cannot nuture the awareness of beauty and Love while </span><em>convinced</em><span> of another's imperfection, suffering, victimhood - basic 'wrongness'. You can only nurture the beauty in another from an awareness of their beauty - and your own.</span><strong><span> Address any immediate 'need' while,</span><em>at the same time,</em><span>remembering what's more True</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Christ not only showed us the way, he created a path, as did Buddha and the other masters. <strong>They created a stream of Truth that will, if we open our hearts to it, return us to the awareness of Beauty and Love in ourselves.</strong> Their</span><span>thoughts, words and actions are the reference points that, if chosen, will produce enlightenment, a perception originating from the perspective of Source.</span></p><p>Merry, Merry Christmas.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div><span><br /></span></div>",

In her book, <span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Transformation-Beginning-Traditions/dp/0385721242\">The Great Transformation</a></span>, she brilliantly details the impetus' for the world's four major religious traditions and does it in a way we can all relate to. K</span><span>aren refers to the Axil Age, a pivotal time beginning in the ninth century BCE when sage teachings first took hold in primary, developed cultures. These sages are familiar to all of us - Isaiah, Confucius, Buddha, Socrates, and many more. With the passion and skill of an artisan, Karen reveals the players, the forces, the decisions and the beliefs that fueled the birth and blossoming of spiritual thought.</span></p><p><span>What she found might surprise you - <strong>spiritual focus and insight were provoked by the destructive forces of their day.</strong> &ldquo;All Axil Age faiths began in principled and visceral recoil from the unprecedented violence of their time. Despite some differences in emphasis, there was a remarkable consensus in their call for an abandonment of selfishness and a spirituality of compassion.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span>I find comfort in this broad, panoramic view. This isn&rsquo;t the first go-around. Mankind has lost perspective before - many times, apparently - and we have, with the help of poets, and wise <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/kimberlyawyatt/the-men-and-their-words/\" target=\"_blank\">men</a> and <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/kimberlyawyatt/the-women-and-their-words/\" target=\"_blank\">women</a>, found our way back to higher ground. It seems as though we need to fall apart on a semi-regular basis in order to remind ourselves about what's essential and what's optional. I suppose</span><span>this falling apart, as painful as it may be, is a good thing.</span><span>It's an opportunity to let go of old assumptions that no longer work, and seek out deeper, fundamental truths.</span></p>",

Are you more likely to verbally castrate him, or get intimidated and withdraw? Before you answer, read the following. Your answer could be &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo;.</span></p><p><span>The stress response standard for the last 70 years has been &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo;. But health psychologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_E._Taylor\">Shelly Taylor PhD</a>. and five of her colleagues revisited research results after Taylor realized this &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; model didn&rsquo;t fit any of the findings she&rsquo;d seen in her 30 years of practice. Looking closer at the studies, they found the stress responses were identified through research based heavily on studies of male animals.</span></p><p><span>In an article for <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200009/tend-and-befriend\">Psychology Today</a>, Taylor and her colleagues propose that women&rsquo;s coping mechanisms have evolved uniquely, within the context of the role of primary caregiver. They believe, when in danger, a woman will first consider the comfort and well-being of her child and tend to its needs.<strong> At a chemical level, the bonding hormone oxytocin reduces her fearfulness and lowers the typical fight-or-flight response.</strong></span><span>Another noted effect credited to oxytocin is the enhancement of social contact, which explains the second stress response more often shown by women - to connect with others, particularly women.</span><span>Move over &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; and make room for <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/06/love-hormone/\">&ldquo;tend-and-befriend&rdquo;</a>.</span></p><p><span>As a former stressed-out single mother raising two daughters I can attest to this model. My girls will back me on this - my default stress responses were to clean and organize the house and/or call my sister and trade war stories. I have zero memories of a &lsquo;fight&rsquo; response and if I &lsquo;flew&rsquo;, it was to the safety of my home, where I started neatening.</span><span>Tending and befriending is part of my chemical make-up.</span></p><p><span>I'm happy to say that I've learned to deal differently with stress. When I get wound up these days, a</span><span>long with caring for others, I use my oxytocin to</span><span>tend and befriend myself. There&rsquo;s a lot I could say about this, so maybe I'll write about it <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/06/love-hormone/\">in another post</a>.</span></p><p><span>Something to note: Taylor and the others are careful to say they aren&rsquo;t trying to assign stress responses to either gender. All of us can have all of them. Good. It's nice to know we have options. It helps keep the stress down...</span></p>",

      "content": "<p>Your smoke alarm goes off in the middle of the night. Adrenaline is pumped into your system. Your amygdala, the area in your brain that processes fear, revs up. At the same time, the hormone oxytocin might also be released, regulating your amygdala's activity. The likelyhood of this hormonal intervention seems to depend a lot on <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/08/make-room-tend-and-befriend/\">whether you're female</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200009/tend-and-befriend\">Some researchers</a> believe response-suppressing oxytocin is produced in women because they are biologically invested in their children's survival, but <strong>it's been dubbed \"the love hormone\" because it's also produced during a number of other behaviors where there's a potential for bonding. </strong>Oxytocin is released in large amounts in women during childbirth and breastfeeding. It's also produced in both men and women during sex, evoking feelings of trust, contentment and safety with their mate.</p><p>I had my own unique way of discovering oxytocin. After <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/11/it-changed-everything/\">Al</a> passed away I craved comfort, but didn't have anyone to turn to. Listening to my body, I started spending large amounts of time outside, letting the sun warm me. Then I started visiting a jacuzzi at least three times a week, and if I couldn't get to one, I'd soak in a hot bath. I did 'hot' yoga and enrolled in a class to become a massage therapist, giving and receiving at least 4 massages a week. Fortunately for me, my daughters are huggers, so, even though they weren't living at home, I could look forward to hugs and physical contact when they visited.</p><p>I guess I wasn't surprised when I ran across the research about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/hottopics/love/\">\"the love hormone\"</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.raysahelian.com/oxytocin.html\">Dr. Ray Sahelian, M.D.</a>, oxytocin can be released by a variety of sensory stimuli, including warmth and touch. <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/11/my-imperfect-body/\">My body must have known that</a>. It's great when science confirms my experience, and hot tea, hot baths, touch, and soft blankets are now an integral part of my daily life.</p>",

Period.</strong></p><p>So I jumped online, Ebay classifieds to be specific, and did a search for puppies. I've never had my own dog, but I'd toyed with the idea of getting one on-and-off, so I had some notion of what type of dog I wanted - small, so it could travel easily with me, bred for companionship, so it will care if I'm around (cats don't seem to notice!) and non-shedding, hypoallergenic.</p><p>A search for \"puppies\" in my area brought up just a few, with pictures. There was only one that caught my eye, a 10 week old, black and white, Maltese/Pomeranian mix. I called the number immediately and set up a time to meet the breeder. Next day I drove the hour and a half north to meet them.</p><p>I saw her face as they drove into the parking lot. She was peeking over the shoulder of the woman in the passenger seat, and I knew immediately she was for me - curious, intelligent, adorable. She made the drive home with her little head resting on my thigh.</p><p>I named her Bo. She hates to be alone at any time, but especially at night. I don't sleep well any more. She pees everywhere and barks incessantly if she's separated from me in any way - even by a small security fence she can see through.</p><p><strong>No-one said Love was easy.</strong></p><p>Note: I've since done the research and found that Maltese is one of the oldest breeds, bred by the Greeks as companion dogs. They never left their owners, 'traveling' in the sleeves of their robes. It's all clear to me now....</p>",

Nearly all of us have experienced the 'death' of a long-held belief, relationship or dream. We know the pain of loss.</p><p>I'm sure that's why Easter is such a popular time. It's the designated season for celebrating resurrection and rebirth, the belief that what was lost in death can be restored - not only restored, but reborn to a new and more glorious state.</p><p>I need this day.<strong> I need a tangible reminder of this life-death-life cycle and the symbolic traditions that support the idea of a larger, spiritual reality.</strong></p><p>Easter reminds us there's a world beyond this physical day-to-day, one step removed from our rational understanding, what Carl Jung called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious\">\"the collective unconscious\"</a>, what shamans call the<a href=\"http://www.spiritual-healing-artwork-4u.com/spiritual-shamanism.html\">\"underworld\"</a>, and what Christ refered to as <a href=\"http://www.tm.org/blog/enlightenment/kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/\">\"the kingdom of heaven\"</a>. On specially designated days - Easter, Christmas, Hanukkah, Eid Al-Adha- we acknowledge this mystical realm. We approach the threshold between worlds and attempt to part the veil in order to glimpse the majesty beyond. We do this through ritual, prayer, art, myth, symbolism - and through metaphor. </p><p>The life, death and resurrection of Christ is a metaphor I keep close to my heart. Of all the mysteries, the necessity of death seems to me the most mysterious.<strong> The story of Christ's life answers a deep forgetting and reminds me, \"That which is True can never really die.\" and, \"Let the death of 'what was' be rich, fertile soil for 'what is yet to be'.</strong></p><p>And, what about 'what is yet to be'? The promise of the Christ metaphor is this - if we allow ourselves to 'die' regarding the things of the physical world, we will be 'reborn' to an understanding of the Truth. We will awaken to the Beauty within us.</p><p>This is my prayer this Easter season - may I live this promise. </p>",

      "content": "<p><span>After <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/08/remembering-love/\">Al died</a>I desperately needed to find a way to bring my spiritual experiences closer to my physical reality. I began studying various spiritual traditions and practices, but found that even the most well-intended of them lacked the full, original, unadulterated insight that I needed. I attributed this to the natural devolution of Truth as it's translated from one generation to the next. The one answer they seemed unable to provided was the one answer I </span><em><span>had</span></em><span>to find - <strong>What is the relationship between my imperfect, physical body and my perfect, spiritual nature? </strong></span></p><p><span>During a visit to </span><em>Mount Madonna</em><span> (</span><a href=\"http://www.mountmadonna.org\">http://www.mountmadonna.org</a><span>/) in the Santa Cruz mountains, I got my first clue. Hindu teachings about yoga and our chakra systems speak to the inherent union between our physical bodies and our energy bodies</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Since then I&rsquo;ve deepened my search and my study, and what has evolved is a personal, intuitive practice of &lsquo;physical meditation&rsquo; that includes dance, aerobics, yoga, stretching and stillness. As I&rsquo;ve deepened these practices, I&rsquo;ve noticed inherent &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; benefits.</span></p><p><span>1- <strong>It brings me </strong></span><strong><em>into </em></strong><span><strong>my body</strong>, into my current moment, my physical experience. Muscles, breathing, movement, sweat. Good stuff.</span></p><p><span>2- <strong>It requires a sustained discipline of attention on my inner world</strong>. Balance, intention, stretching, strength of will and determination.</span></p><p><span>3- <strong>It provides a physical metaphor for my spiritual states.</strong> When I dance, I&rsquo;m expressing my soul&rsquo;s joy. When I&rsquo;m doing yoga poses - the camel pose, child&rsquo;s pose or mountain pose - I&rsquo;m physically embodying the emotional states of open-heartedness, humility and strength. When I work out with a physio ball, I&rsquo;m acting out the experience of balance.</span></p><p><span>4- <strong>It teaches me to become aware of my energy and how I use it.</strong> Do I have enough? If not, why? Better sleep? Better nutrition? Better company? The energy that I </span><em>do</em><span> have, where is it going? When doing the Downward Facing Dog yoga pose, I&rsquo;m focused on my palms pressing into the mat, my heels touching down behind, and my tail lifting to the sky. I&rsquo;m paying attention. I&rsquo;m directing my energy. I&rsquo;m listening to my self in a whole new way.</span></p><p><span>5 - <strong>Most importantly, what I&rsquo;ve learned through &lsquo;physical meditation&rsquo; is that my body is a gift</strong>, a vehicle to be celebrated, for it gives me <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/06/first-entry/\">the opportunity to experience and express</a> the truth of who I am.</span></p><p><span>I</span><span> love and appreciate my body, and as I love it, so do I love my self. I invite you to develop your own practice of &lsquo;physical meditation&rsquo;.</span></p>",

      "content": "<p>From my journal June 2012...</p><p><span>\"Last night</span><span>I began meditating a little earlier so I wouldn&rsquo;t be so tired and fall asleep. Was thinking about Erin, about my girls when they were babies. I was so young - hadn&rsquo;t felt ready to be a mother - had not felt mothered myself.</span></p><p><span>I'd been reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537\">Steve Job's biography</a> and thought how he&rsquo;d been abandoned by his birth mother, hadn't been wanted. Remembered how I'd felt unwanted and unloved. It is a theme - many of us feeling the absence of our mothers.</span></p><p><span>I began meditating on my loving, mother feelings, remembering Erin as a newborn. I imagined her small again and that I was holding her in my arms.</span></p><p><span>I wanted to go back, back to the times when the men in my life had put me down, had told my girls I wasn&rsquo;t loving. I wanted to go back and say &ldquo;I love my daughters. The error you see in me is the error you won't see as your own. Do </span><em>not</em><span> bring it here and hurt my child. I will protect them from you.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t do that then, but I could do it now - I have that power, that clarity.</span></p><p><span>So I went back in my heart, to that time, and I held my baby close and felt the sureness of my Mother Love. I meditated on my love for my daughters, let the Mother Love take me.</span><span>Went to bed and had a dream...</span></p><p><span>I'm driving down a residential street in a old car. I suddenly swerve to the right to avoid hitting a woman lying in the street, wounded. I stop and jump out of the car and quickly go to her, cover her with my coat because she is naked. I think to get the denim quilt out of my car, but it isn&rsquo;t there, it&rsquo;s in the other car.</span></p><p><span>I take the woman home, to one of the homes on the street. In her room is her baby. The baby has been hurt by the woman, by the things she didn&rsquo;t know. The baby is a newborn, but she is able to talk. She is saying that she knew, remembers the world before her birth. She knows she came with a purpose, even though she has been hurt. It is part of the plan.</span></p><p><span>I want to heal the baby. I pick her up and hold her little, naked body to my heart. I hope that the skin-to-skin comfort will heal the baby. I lie down on the bed and a Father Spirit covers us with a soft, quilted comforter.</span></p><p><span>I&rsquo;m lying on the bed and look up. I can see an angel above us, near the ceiling. The angel calls to me and I leave my body to join the angel. It feels so sweet to go to the angel. Just as I get there, someone, a man, comes into the room and my attention is brought back. I return to the bed.\"</span></p><p><em>\"While some who write in psychology today tout the leaving of the entire mother matrix as though it were a coup....in truth, the construct and concept of the wild mother can never and should never be abandoned. For if it is, a woman abandons her own deep nature, the one with all the knowing in it, all the bags of seeds, all the thorn needles for mending, all the medicines for work and rest and love and hope.\"</em> <a href=\"http://www.clarissapinkolaestes.com/index.htm\">Clarissa Pinkola Estes, PhD</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>My friend John once asked me, &ldquo;Do you think some people are born to lead? And do you think people, by nature, are drawn to follow?&rdquo; John was a senior fellow at an Ivy League school and President/CEO of his own international bioscience company. He&rsquo;d answered his own questions about his potential as a leader, but wanted to know my thoughts on the subject.</p><p>My response was part instinct, part hard-earned wisdom from my time directing a nonprofit, managing a large number of employees. &ldquo;A natural leader addresses something that seems obvious to them that isn&rsquo;t obvious to others. It&rsquo;s an organic process of recognizing a potential and inspiring people toward that improved vision. And, yes, some people, perhaps most people, need a leader. But there are also those who have figured out enough that they need minimal guidance. And then there are those who have their life so together that a leader would just get in their way.<strong> A true leader will know when they are necessary and when they are not.</strong>&rdquo;</p><p>With her book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947\">Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead</a></em>, Sheryl Sandberg has prompted a discussion about why there aren&rsquo;t more women in corporate and political leadership roles. As CEO of Facebook she&rsquo;s in the ideal position to start the dialogue. She proposes that women, particularly young women anticipating careers in a corporate setting, need to look within themselves to identify and overcome internal obstacles that keep them from aspiring to the top levels:</p><p>&ldquo;We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small by lacking self confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in. My argument is that getting rid of these internal barriers is critical to gaining power.&rdquo;</p><p>The dialogue continued last week with Arianna Huffington&rsquo;s conference, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/third-metric\">The Third Metric: Redefining Success Beyond Money and Power</a>. Arianna highlights what has become obvious to so many - if a woman aspires to lead in the current corporate climate it will come at a high cost. For maximum effectiveness, she recommends we all &ldquo;lean back&rdquo; (like a cat ready jump!) before leaning in:</p><p>&ldquo;This is a great moment for all of us - women and men - to acknowledge that the current male-dominated model of success isn&rsquo;t working for women, and it&rsquo;s not working for men either. The world needs women to redefine success beyond money and power.\"</p><p>There is such a thing as natural leaders, like Sheryl and Arianna - smart, successful women using their advantaged perspectives to inspire us. And I believe there are many wise women who have yet to recognize this same ability within themselves, not only because they lack confidence or adequate sleep, but because they are limited to environments entrenched in masculine definitions. <strong>We need women to imagine options not currently being offered. What visions might we women lead toward if we were to disconnect from the masculine model, return to our bodies, become mindful, and imagine a life for ourselves and our world that&rsquo;s an expression of our highest conscience?</strong></p><p>I can&rsquo;t help but mention one more observation that I&rsquo;ll write about more in another post. We refer to two environments, corporate and political, as the contexts within which leaders will be formed. I&rsquo;m noticing a third. <strong>Grass roots movements and crowd-driven phenomenon are now the children of the online world</strong> (think- TED, Kickstart, Feminie Power Global Community and Meetup.com). This is where future leaders will find a third venue.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a great time to be a woman with a vision. </p>",

      "content": "<p>The eye of the needle...the fifth chakra...the process of facing negative beliefs, conscious and unconscious, and allowing love to transform them...</p><p>Reading \"The Mythic Image\" by Joseph Campbell and the Kundalini Yoga book from my sister, I better understand what's at stake. This is the gateway, the clashing rocks, the guardian of the threshold.</p><p>In his chapter \"Transformations of the Inner Light\" Campbell describes the experience of waking the fourth chakra - the heart chakra - as \"the place where the sound is heard that is not made by any two things striking together\".</p><p>\"<strong>Once the great mystery sound has been heard, the whole desire of the heart will be to learn to know it more fully</strong>, to hear it, not through things and during certain fortunate moments only, but immediately and forever. The attainment of this end will be the project of the next chakra, the fifth chakra...\"</p><p>In the Upanishad, the fifth chakra is described as \"...the sharpened edge of a razor, hard to traverse\". The practitioner at the \"purgatorial fifth chakra\" is striving to clear their consciousness of the \"turbulence of secondary things\". It is called \"Vishudda\", which means \"purified\".</p><p><strong>The fifth chakra is about communication. The focus is on our will and it's expression.</strong> At this level love has been awakened and we are aware of the \"secondary\" agenda of our ego. <strong>We are beginning the process of choosing between the will of our ego and the will of God.</strong>The way is narrow because to 'hear' God's Will one must be aligned and attuned. Less than loving beliefs and influences of the ego can, and do, distract.</p><p>And yet, this is \"the whole desire of the heart\", and as we clear our consciousness of the beliefs, traditions and judgements that our ego would have us cling to - we are more able to join our will with God's Will and allow it's expression. This is the experience of 'genius', of creative expression moving freely from Higher consciousness through us.</p><p>This is Love being brought to this physical experience, one belief at a time.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Dear Martha,</p><p>I just finished reading &ldquo;Leaving the Saints&rdquo; for the first time.</p><p>Thank-you.</p><p>My lineage is one of courageous, beautiful, powerful women who loved God with open hearts. My great-great-great-great grandmother, Hanna Libby Knight, converted to the Mormon church in 1834 and knew Joseph Smith personally. Her daughter, Sarah York and Sarah&rsquo;s husband, William F. Carter, were among the Church&rsquo;s first practicing polygamists.</p><p>The &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; assumed authority in the name of God, and broke my Mothers&rsquo; trusting hearts. Joseph and the brethren were in error. <strong>God has no need for authority or control.</strong></p><p>A broken heart and a mistrust of God were my inheritance - but so were courage and a belief in good. I left the Church in 1988, when I was 29, to seek out the truth and heal from the lies of my past. Healing has come as I experience true, unconditional Love - Love that isn&rsquo;t limited by sexual definitions.</p><p>My journey has taken me close to the &lsquo;veil&rsquo;, where Love seems more accessible. This expanded experience opened naturally to me as I focused on the love I had for my husband during the months leading up to his death from a brain tumor.</p><p><strong>Perhaps this is the most powerful way to heal the wounds of the spirit, through direct, personal experience of Love that accepts all of it - even the misuse of power.</strong></p><p>I enjoyed reading about your experience with the Light. You have a gift for expressing things that aren&rsquo;t easily conveyed. I&rsquo;ve told a few people about my own experiences, but find my lack of ability, along with their skepticism, make for a frustrating dialogue.</p><p>I understand your desire to return to the state of awareness you enjoyed while expecting your son Adam. <strong>Once I&rsquo;d felt the freedom, peace and warmth of the God&rsquo;s Love, returning to that state of awareness became all that mattered to me.</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned patience and humility. That said, my overriding passion is to heal whatever is necessary to bring my day-to-day, physical experience closer to that state of Love - to remember.</p><p>This is my challenge and my joy.</p><p>I finished the book I was working on when I attended your writing seminar. I don&rsquo;t intend to publish. It was for my own clarity alone. Kept the title - &ldquo;Making Love&rdquo;.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Ardyn Wyatt</p><p>P.S. The greatest power is the power to choose. The greatest choice is Love.</p>",

Even so, I was suspecting that there was an area that was more conducive - a city with less baggage attached, fewer memories that dragged on me.</p><p>But moving's a big deal, and it wasn't entirely clear the direction to go.

At some level, my inner wisdom <em>knows </em>which is best. Perhaps I just let my mind drift lightly over an imagined 'picture' of each, and see which one my body's inner knowing responds to.</p><p>Do I 'open' inside? Does my heart seem to warm and expand? Does something 'click' into place? Do my thoughts feel calm, simple and obvious? Do I feel a bubbly sensation rise up from my gut? <strong>I've had each of these be an indicator of which was the best choice, like the fog dispersed and the path lit up in front of me.</strong></p><p>This is inspiration, and I can take from this 'guidance' with confidence and joyful anticipation.</p>",

      "content": "<p>If a great tree stands among other great trees in a forest, does it make a noise?</p><p>I think it does, we just have to listen more closely. Megan Marshall has attuned our ears in her biography<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Fuller-New-American-Life/dp/0547195605\"> <em>Margaret Fuller: A New American Life.</em></a> As I read this story I found it hard to believe I'd never heard of this great woman, had never before been introduced to her insights.</p><p>Sarah Margaret Fuller, born May 23, 1810 in Cambridge Massachusetts, was the precocious eldest daughter of Timothy Fuller, a Harvard Law graduate and aspiring politician. Her intelligence and willingness were recognized early, and she effortlessly took on the potential of an eldest son, raised in her father's image. Her formal education, though priviledged, was restricted to private grammar school and academies for young women, which she completed by age 16. Other than this limited educational encouragement, Margaret was home-schooled and self-taught.</p><p>Her father's aquaintances, as well as his ambitions, allowed Margaret access to the area's cultural leaders. Her friends were the artistic, philosophical and intellectual elete of the generation -<a href=\"http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm\"> Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, Henry David Thereau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Bronson Alcott, to name a few.</p><p>Even among this company, her accomplishments were exceptional: she created a salon, <em>Conversations</em>, intending to provoke women's intellects, and wrote the seminal feminist work, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_in_the_Nineteenth_Century\"><em>Women in the Nineteeth Century</em>.</a> As the first editor of Emerson's trascendentalist journal,<em>The Dial, </em>Margaret became known as one of the leaders in the Transcedentalist Movement. As a columnist for Horace Greeley's<em>New York Tribune, </em>she advocated for the poor, slaves and for women's rights, and by 1846 became the publication's first female editor. That same year she left for Europe and became our country's first female foreign correspondent.</p><p>And yet, as I witnessed the arch of her life, these notable accomplishments were not what impressed me most. What touched me, what sunk deep into the heart of me, was<strong> her ability to trascend the circumstances of her life, and of that day, to find a greater truth in her experience as a woman.</strong></p><p><strong>I recognize her instincts to seek out and study what was worthy, noble and honorable, and to hold these as her standard </strong>even though, as a woman, there was no cultural support for her in these efforts.<strong> I appreciate her courage and willfulness, her willingness to hold a position of tension between her aspirations and ideals, and the reality of the cultural barriers of that time. I honor her courage to acknowledge her hopes, even though doing so must have highlighted the painful truth - that she would never attain that which she could so clearly see.</strong></p><p>I'm incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to become aquainted with Margaret Fuller. She possessed a clarity of vision, thought and word that emanated from her life and transcended the definitions of her generation. Thank-you, Margaret, for asking, \"How is it that I seem to be this Margaret Fuller? What does it mean? What shall I do about it?\" . Thank-you for \"longing to experience life with (my) 'woman's heart'\". <strong>And thank-you for having an imagination that \"empower(ed) you to incessant acts of vigorous beauty.\"</strong></p>",

Less fear getting in the way.</p><p>The mistaken belief was that I was small, smaller than the context I found myself in, smaller that my family, my community, my church, the attitudes of the world toward me as a woman.</p><p><strong>So many circles of influences, all insisting that I play myself down so that they could feel comfortable.</strong></p><p>There was nowhere for me to fit 'out there', so I went in.

Tap into the infinite field of the feminine and bring forth from that place.</strong></p><p>Meditation, silence, allows gaps between thoughts - thoughts that are the program of our culture. As the gaps widen, new ideas and awarenesses from the Creative Field are allowed to float up into our conscience awareness. This practice strengthens our relationship with the bigger context of the Feminine Creative.</p><p><strong>Go wider. Go deeper. Get bigger.</strong></p><p><strong>Go to a different place than where you've already been - outside what has been offered, beyond the definitions of this well-defined world.</strong></p><p>The belief that was holding me back? \"I am defined by this physical, masculine-oriented, power-driven context.\"</p><p>As I've nurtured and strengthened an awareness of this femininity, this Feminine Creative, the limits of this physical world and it's assumptions, structures, definitions and games, are easier to see, easier to leave behind.</p><p><strong>I'm returning to the Feminine, in order to experience myself as accepted, held, nurtured, sustained, loved, protected.</strong></p>",

I was pleasantly surprised at much I could relate to people who hold views so completely contrary to mine. When the father and uncle use their guns, I don't think they do it as a political statement. It's truly just part of who they are.\"</p><p>\"Yes, it's who they are, but guns are still for killing and I don't want them in my home,\" my daughter responds.</p><p><strong>And in her response, I hear that I haven't made myself clear.

I want to be accurate, to be understood.</strong></p><p>\"<em><strong>I'm not pro gun, but I am pro human. </strong></em>I think my surprise was to find I could relate to them on a very human level. They seem genuine, particularly Phil and Si. And you don't see that kind of genuine on T.V. much.\"</p><p><strong>As the words leave my mouth, I realize I had to find these 'more true' words in answer to a necessity born of dialogue and I'm grateful to my daughter for insisting I find them.</strong></p>",

I knew that starting my new business, and journaling about my spiritual journey, would have obstacles. I imagined coming face-to-face with the unfamiliar and the discouraging, but I thought the process would be clean. I thought my journaling would be tidy, and that I&rsquo;d have the insight to convey my experiences in an engaging, google-search-worthy, enlightening package.</p><p>Instead, this creative pursuit has exposed unconscious, self-sabotaging relationships and beliefs that have remained, despite all previous efforts, and undermined my life and my happiness.<strong>My commitment to creating something worthy, something that accurately reflects the best I know to be true about myself, has become an exercise in vigilance, persistence, courage and humility beyond anything I anticipated.</strong></p><p>In <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1936891026/?tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=31655411797&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=14326155803626609513&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_2y0yuqzbcd_b\">The War of Art</a></em>, Steven Pressfield describes with intimate transparency the role of resistance in the creative process.

This is how Art is born.</p><p>So, tidy, search-worthy and engaging have been abandoned for clear, simple and true. If it happens to be enlightening, great. I&rsquo;ll consider it a happy surprise.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;ve been including excerpts directly from my personal journal, sharing more about the emotional process of confronting my limiting beliefs.

      "content": "<p>This admonition from <a href=\"http://www.clarissapinkolaestes.com/\">Dr. Estes</a> has seen me through many moments...</p><p><span>My friends, do not lose heart. We were made for these times. I have heard from so many recently who are deeply and properly bewildered. They are concerned about the state of affairs in our world now. Ours is a time of almost daily astonishment and often righteous rage over the latest degradations of what matters most to civilized, visionary people.</span></p><p>You are right in your assessments. The luster and hubris some have aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders, everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is breathtaking.<strong> Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. </strong>Especially do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were made for these times. Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement.</p><p>I grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never before in the history of humankind.</p><p>Look out over the prow; there are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. <strong>Even though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy roil, I assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless.</strong></p><p>In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is spending the wind without raising the sails.</p><p><strong>We are needed, that is all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know them when they appear.</strong> Didn't you say you were a believer? Didn't you say you pledged to listen to a voice greater? Didn't you ask for grace? Don't you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the voice greater?</p><p>Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. <strong>Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely.</strong> It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.</p><p>What is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. <strong>We know that it does not take everyone on Earth to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second,<em> or hundredth gale.</em></strong></p><p>One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul.<strong> Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. </strong>The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these &ndash; to be fierce and to show mercy toward others; both are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity.</p><p><span>Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do.</span></p><p>There will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it.<strong> I will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate.</strong></p><p>The reason is this: In my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. <strong>It is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here. The good words we say and the good deeds we do are not ours. They are the words and deeds of the One who brought us here.</strong> In that spirit, I hope you will write this on your wall: <em><strong>When a great ship is in harbor and moored, it is safe, there can be no doubt. But that is not what great ships are built for.</strong></em></p>",

I was feeling alone, truly discouraged by the challenges and resistance I'd been facing.</p><p>Then I felt Christmas coming.</p><p>And I was no longer alone.</p><p>With thoughts about forgiveness, my mind turned toward a piece from my book <em>Making Love.</em>I'd like to share it.</p><p><em><span>The mass in Al's brain was the size of a lime. They did an x-ray, but only after we&rsquo;d secured admission from the triage nurse.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;Try to look sick,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d whispered to Al. If the nurses detected his natural charisma, caught a glimpse of his dark eyes and Cheshire smile, they may not notice the subtle symptoms that only seemed obvious to me. He obediently dropped his chin to his chest, rolling his head slightly to one side. What a ham.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;We want them to admit you, not bury you.&rdquo;  </span></em></p><p><em><span>When he brought the x-ray in, the doctor said the mass could be a number of things, infection, fluid - but his words came in short clips, and he couldn&rsquo;t look either of us in the eye. He&rsquo;d shown us the image as though relieving a burden, hoping we'd grasp the implications. But we simply stared silently at the x-ray in trusting ignorance.</span></em><em></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need to do more tests,&rdquo; he said, and left us to our imaginations.</span></em></p><p><em><span>They moved us into a room down a hall, around a corner, somewhere in the belly of the building. We waited alone, not knowing what we waited for.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold in here.\"</span></em><em>Al was on a stainless steel gurney in a too-small gown, the brown skin of his back sticking to the cool, unforgiving surface.</em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;It looks like the room for burn victims.&rdquo;</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;No more beds in the ER, I guess.&rdquo; His voice was innocent, almost reverent. Al was being accommodating, generous, bargaining with fate in hopes of negotiating positive test results.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I sat awkwardly next to the gurney in a stackable chair. The room&rsquo;s harsh fluorescent lights created a sallow tint on Al&rsquo;s skin. The room was filled with his silence, the overwhelming absence of his self-absorbed monologue. Outside in the hall were intermittent, muffled sounds of hospital movement. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Al&rsquo;s gown had loosened and I tucked the hem of it under his knee. It was too small and no one was coming. He</span></em><em><span>lay patient and still, his hands folded meekly on his chest, like a defenseless child, alone. His vulnerability touched something deep in me, and a memory rose in my mind.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I was five years old and at home with my family on a Monday night. Dad was telling stories while the kids lay on the floor, our feet stretched facing the fire. My toes were warm. There were six of us with pillows, including Kath and me.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Mother had a plan. She wanted each of us to have special time alone with Dad. We&rsquo;d go to dinner with him. We&rsquo;d take turns, oldest to youngest.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always last!&rdquo; I whined. So Mother said we&rsquo;d draw straws. It would be fair.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Mother plucked six straws from her broom and pinched them in the palm of her hand. We each pulled one and held them up. I&rsquo;d drawn the shortest straw and my family erupted in laughter. They were laughing at me, at my designated spot at the bottom. They were glad to have escaped the bottom. I was struck silent, tingling with shame.</span></em></p><p><em><span>That moment of aloneness was still alive in me. </span></em></p><p><em><span>The steel room was getting colder and still no one came. Tiny goose bumps were rising up on Al&rsquo;s legs. I took off my sweater and wrapped it across his chest. They could have at least given him a blanket.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Even with my feelings of empathy, I wasn&rsquo;t forgetting Al&rsquo;s offenses. They had weight and mass in my memory. This was the man who, for nine years, had relentlessly belittled my emotions and taken advantage of my inexperience and generosity. His sins were still real to me.</span></em></p><p><em>Yet, as I realized where we were and the possible implications of what was still to come, the significance of Al's offenses began to loose their status. I began to soften toward this man I still loved.</em></p><p><em></em><em><span>But the rational, reasonable part of me didn&rsquo;t want to soften. It wanted to hold him responsible. What he'd done to me was wrong and had hurt me terribly. I didn't have to forgive him and I shouldn&rsquo;t have to save him from the consequences of his choices. </span></em></p><p><em><span>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to care, the one voice in my head told me. But their was another voice - soft, steady and sure. My heart was still open and I was face to face with my beliefs about love.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;How long have we been here?&rdquo; Al asked.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered quietly, still remembering that night thirty-five years ago, and Mother&rsquo;s voice, crisp and final after the laughter.</span></em></p><p><em><span>&ldquo;O.K. kids, time for bed.&rdquo; </span></em></p><p><em><span>Kath and I had twin beds in a room at the end of the hall. Mother left us each with a peck on the forehead and the room went silent. I was silent. I was at the bottom and lost, stunned by my family&rsquo;s abrupt rejection. I didn&rsquo;t understand, and lay staring into the darkness of the room.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In the quiet I felt my covers move, lifted back, and a nudge. Wordlessly, Kath pulled herself next to me on the bed. Her head on my pillow, she stretched her arm over and around me like a wing. Her knees fit snug into the back of my legs.</span></em></p><p><em><span>I wasn&rsquo;t alone. Kath and I were connected. We held onto each other. Remembering the assumption of love and its sweet innocence, I forgot the sting of my family's harshness and the world that created it. Kath and I had an unspoken understanding - w</span></em><em>e shared, we took turns.</em><em><span>There was no winner and looser, there was room for both of us. </span></em></p><p><em></em><strong><em><span>The assumption of love was a very big place. </span></em></strong></p><p><em><span>With each breath I felt the reassuring rise and fall of Kath&rsquo;s arm. Doubt and fear softened into pale shades of grey and fell away. Kath and I fell asleep together, like spoons.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In the cold of the steel room, I remembered love, all of it, and I had a choice to make. I pulled my chair up next to Al, until my knees touched the gurney. I leaned into him and touched his chest, lowering myself beside his cheek.</span></em></p><p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying,&rdquo; I whispered. Al&rsquo;s lips moved silently into a gentle smile. He wasn&rsquo;t alone. &ldquo;Whatever they tell us. No matter what comes, I&rsquo;m staying.&rdquo; A drop from the corner of Al&rsquo;s eye fell and I caught it with my waiting fingers.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p><span>My first marathon was the San Francisco in 1997. I trained with the Lymphoma &amp; Leukemia Society&rsquo;s Team in Training because I knew I was much more likely to go the distance if crossing the finish line meant benefitting another.</span></p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot I could say about the lessons learned while training for an endurance event. I learned to discipline myself to a demanding schedule. I learned to eat and drink like an athlete. I learned to take <em>really good </em>care of my feet.</p><p><strong>More than that, I learned to listen to my body.</strong> I found my heart and breathing rates were the best way to assess my conditioning relative to stressors. I discovered my brain would start producing endorphins on each run at about the six mile mark when my mind would become clear and relaxed.</p><p>When the scheduled distances increased to over 16 miles, the challenges became more mental than physical. My mindset evolved - &ldquo;How do I train<em> through</em> whatever might show up?&rdquo; - because I was committed to crossing the finish line.</p><p>All valuable lessons. And, on the day of the run, I appreciated every one of them. But all of them pale in comparison to the lesson I learned the day of the marathon at mile 24.5.</p><p>Mile 21 was &ldquo;the wall&rdquo; - when my body exhausted all it's chemical energy in the form of glycogen in the muscles and liver. I remember thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running on pure determination now.\"<strong>I was fueled exclusively by the energy of<em> will </em>from that time on, b</strong><strong>ecause there was simply nothing physical left to draw on.</strong></p><p>At mile 22, I remember my Dad joining me to run the last few miles - not clear, very fuzzy, something about the top of my head being very hot. Basically, delirium.</p><p>And then came mile 24.5. We were on a small rise on a road in Golden Gate park leading toward Kezar Stadium. I could just hear the band music playing at the finish line. I turned, spontaneously to my Dad, threw my arms in the air and chirped <strong>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we show what we&rsquo;re made of!&rdquo;</strong> </p><p>I had reached the &lsquo;zone&rsquo;, when all that was left was me, the next step, and a sense of my Self I never knew I had - <strong>a Self that transcended whatever obstacles remained in my imagination. My awareness could not have been more potent or more present, because there was nothing else left</strong> - no past successes to refer to, no inflated ideas about the finish - just me, my Self, and the moment.</p><p><strong>All that training. All that effort and focus, and it wasn&rsquo;t about the finish line.</strong> Of course, if the finish line hadn&rsquo;t been the goal, I never would have discovered &lsquo;the moment&rsquo;, but finishing was a given. The actual gift was totally unexpected. <strong>The real gift was the unencumbered moment, the experience of finding out what I was truly made of.</strong></p>",

I&rsquo;m upgrading, and some are taking it personally. <strong>Still snagged on barbed beliefs about comparison and competition, it seems they need me to fail in order to feel good about themselves.</strong> If they&rsquo;re to stay in dialogue with me, it means they&rsquo;ll have to take a closer look at their motives.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a very painful and gradual realization on my part. I didn&rsquo;t want it to be true, because I didn&rsquo;t want to have to make the choice between someone I love and my own success and happiness.

I see you - a determined, open-hearted, creative young woman with a dream of happiness for her life.</p><p>I see the perfect, pure being that you were when you first arrived for this adventure. You are still that being. <strong>You are God&rsquo;s own child, pure Love, pure innocence. If I could give you anything, it would be the memory of this truth about yourself.</strong></p><p>It is what is most true. It is what I see when I see you through the eyes of my heart. It is what I know.</p><p>Even though the circumstances that surround you may seem overwhelming, may convince you otherwise, ignore them. You are not a victim. You are a powerful, free creator. <strong>You are included fully in God&rsquo;s Love, and any belief, person, organization or memory that even hints otherwise is a lie.</strong></p><p>More than that, the Truth about you doesn&rsquo;t live in any outward condition or circumstance. It lives deep within you. <strong>Pure beauty and Love live quietly, in the shelter of your heart.</strong> This pure beauty will burn away the lies.</p><p>Spend time there. Remember with me.</p><p>This is where I hold you.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Mom</p>",

      "content": "<p><span>Dear Mr. President,</span></p><p>I listened to your <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_614_-_the_president_was_here\">Marc Maron podcast</a> the other day. Thank-you for making yourself accessible, for the chance to experience you in a person-to-person, man-cave-garage dialogue.</p><p>Even though I read your book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dreams-My-Father-Story-Inheritance/dp/1400082773\">Dreams from My Father</a></em> several years ago, it touched me to listen to you shed light on some of the decisions that went into organizing your life. &ldquo;Trying on different outfits&rdquo;, returning to core values such as honesty and kindness, and forgiving ourselves, are life activities that ring true to many of us.</p><p>I also appreciated hearing your reasoning and discussion about issues surrounding gun safety laws and race relations. Your efforts to break out of old political patterns and connect with the latent decency within the American people was not lost on me.</p><p>So now its easy for me to imagine you in my own living room. And we're having a great conversation over tea. I don't know if you drink tea, or if you can only drink out of unopened water bottles, but protocols and formalities have been dismissed (no disrespect intended). Because, in my imagination we're already in mid-conversation, talking about things that matter and the beautiful truths that form the foundation of our country's belief system and what they mean to the people you lead.</p><p>I can imagine that you might listen to what I have to say, and so I'm telling you about my experience working with high-need families in northern California. The non-profit I directed had amazing success reducing the number of children in group homes using a strengths-based model called <a href=\"http://nwi.pdx.edu/\">Wraparound</a>.</p><p>It worked because we were able to get around some of the prohibitive structures by blending funding streams from several sources, including State, Federal, CPS, Juvenile Justice and Children's Mental Health. More importantly, it worked because the 'treatment' approach was community-based, and <strong>grounded in the assumption that every person we served was innately valuable and in possession of unique strengths. Goodness<em>can</em> be operationalized.</strong></p><p>Thank-you for using words like \"hope\" and \"love\" when discussing what's effective in improving the lives of less advantaged children. <strong>The power within a loving intent is beyond our ability to measure. In our outcome-driven culture we too often undervalue and underestimate the potential effects of pure goodness.</strong></p><p>I've often wondered how it was we lost a sense of reverence for our humanity. Lincoln referred to the &ldquo;better angels of our nature\" and that makes me smile. <strong>It means there was a time when the president of our country could refer to &ldquo;angels\" and &ldquo;our nature&rdquo; in the same sentence, and assume a common understanding with his audience.</strong> Personally, I think he was on to something.</p><p>So much more I could say, but that's enough for now. Again, thank-you for inspiring meaningful dialogue. It's been great 'talking' to you, if only in my imagination.</p><p>I wish you every good thing. You are in my prayers.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I'm on a second draft of my self-published book \"Making Love\". I've changed the title to \"Forgiven: A True Story About True Love \" and I like what it's evolving into. If someone asks what it's about, here's what I'll say:</p><p><span>\"I've, I've fallen off the top. If I make things...right with you...everything will be O.K.\" Al sat across from me, earnestly beseeching my help. Al, the lover who had manipulated, betrayed, belittled and abused me for nearly ten years. I'd left him a year ago, but he'd come to find me, weak on the left side of his body and struggling to produce full sentences. He was in real trouble, and I had a decision to make.</span></p><p><em>Forgiven</em> is a letter to my daughters chronicling the events that facilitated the unfolding of my spiritual understanding. It's an account of my departure from the cloistered culture of the Mormon church and my quest for freedom from my family's generational wounds. It's an exposition of the soulless systems I encountered as a naive, single mother, and my attempts to negotiate them with integrity. It's a story about my love relationships with my daughters, my twin sister and my husband Al, and about the life-changing opportunity he offered me. Ultimately, it's a love story celebrating the challenges and choices that lead me to experience the truth about myself and a reunion with my God.</p><p>Forgiveness is the act of acknowledging and referencing the connective tissue of mystical union, an act of faith that stands witness to the body of our commonly held consciousness. When we choose to forgive another, we claim our identity as God's offspring and call to our experience the gifts of heaven, gifts that heal and inform us. In God's eyes we already exist in perfect, loving union. When we forgive we access this truth directly, weakening the grip of our ego and bringing our true identity closer to our conscious awareness.</p><p>My ability to forgive forms the bridge that lifts me from the confusion and pain of a conflicted world, to peace and communion with God. As I've turned my mind and heart, choice by choice, toward the God within me and a love that includes, my perception has expanded. The practice of forgiveness exposes my true identity, thinning my attachment to judgement and separation, and deepening my relationship with unifying love, grace and guidance. My identity evolves from ideas <em>about</em> my self to a state of <em>being </em>my<em> </em>Self; from, \"Oh, now I <em>get</em> it!\" to, \"Oh, now I'm <em>being</em> it!\"</p><p>This new identity can't be comprehended, only practiced. It's a stance of willingness toward God, a state of openness, non-judgment and humility. We ask what our soul needs to ask, then listen, forgiving whatever may get in the way. We then rest in quiet certainty, listening once again. With the practices of forgiving and listening we come to know Inclusive Love as our context and our true nature, experiencing others, and ourselves, as <em>forgiven</em>.</p>",
