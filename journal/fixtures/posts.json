As I&#39;ve grown, I&#39;ve nurtured a &#39;witness&#39; stance, allowing me to see myself, and my life, from a gentle distance. Some of the things I&#39;ve noticed during this process of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation\">individuation</a>&nbsp;have a lot to do with &quot;remembering Who I really am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My twin sister, Kath, and I were connected, and this sense of connection was very real to both of us.</strong> We often knew what the other was thinking, could finish each other&#39;s sentences, and couldn&#39;t stand to be disloyal to each other or see the other hurt. Ironically, we were born into <strong>a family that encouraged competition as the means of establishing one&#39;s position and value.</strong> There were seven children, the first six born within six years, and you can believe the competition for attention and identity was intense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with that, Kathryn and I were subject to ongoing, personal scrutiny as people often approached us to evaluate our personalities and features in order to &quot;tell us apart&quot;. <strong>The experience of being compared </strong>to her to determine who was &quot;smarter&quot; and who was &quot;prettier&quot; was etched into my psyche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some level, I realized that if I &#39;won&#39; in these impromptu competitions it hurt Kath, since the only means she had to feel secure in her identity was to be &#39;right&#39; <em>in comparison to </em>my &#39;wrong&#39;. <strong>I learned that expressing my uniqueness was a threat to another, and rather than hurt Kathryn, I bowed out of the competition and became silent.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most of my life, I lived in the pain of denying my Truth. The process of &#39;remembering my beauty&#39; has been the process of expanding the context of my awareness to be large enough to include both Kathryn and me in our unique beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I couldn&#39;t hurt Kath, but, at some point, I couldn&#39;t deny myself either, so expanding the context was the only option.</strong> This meant stepping back from the obvious, assuming a &#39;witness&#39; stance, and going into my heart-of-hearts, over and over again, to bring Love, Love big enough for the both of us, to the foreground. <strong>It&#39;s meant <em>willfully</em> cultivating the intention &quot;Love wins&quot;</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intent to find a place that included Kath and me together, and the consistent practice of attending to the Love I had for my sister, has expanded my awareness. Now I know,<strong><em>there is room enough for all of us to shine.&nbsp;</em></strong>A person doesn&#39;t need to judge themself &quot;better&quot; than another in order to experience themself as &quot;good&quot;.

According to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Positive-Psychology-C-Snyder/dp/0195135334\">The Handbook of Positive Psychology</a>, <em>flow</em> has the following characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-intense and focused concentration on what one is doing in the present moment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-merging of action and awareness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-loss of awareness of oneself as a social actor</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-a sense that one can control their actions within the situation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-a sense that time has passed faster than normal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds like a great place, and it is. So I ask again, why don&#39;t we go there more often?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, for one thing, getting into the state of flow means finding an &quot;intrinscally fragile&quot; balance. <strong>If the activity is too challenging, we become anxious, if the activity isn&#39;t challenging enough, we get bored. Flow is a state of &quot;optimal arousal&quot;.</strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"wink\" src=\"http://ardynrosewyatt.com/static/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/wink_smile.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"wink\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it doesn&#39;t come with just any challenging activity.<strong> It seems to be associated with activites we do <em>for pure enjoyment; </em>painting, chess, aethsetic experience, sports or writing. </strong>(I think I&#39;d include <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/ardynrwyatt/\">Pinterest</a> on this list). When we are fully focused on a challenge we feel confident we can meet, and the activity is one we enjoy, we get in the <em>flow</em>. This is the state I&#39;m in every time I write one of these posts. I&#39;m in search of &#39;right expression&#39;, listening, and everything else falls aways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m talking about it, actually I&#39;m advocating for it, because flow is the state we&#39;re looking for when we want to be creative.It&#39;s no accident that the concept was first studied after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi\">Csikszentmihalyi </a>noticed that &quot;when work on a painting was going well, the artist persisted single-mindedly, disregarding hunger, fatigue and discomfort.&quot;It&#39;s the Alpha state.<strong> It&#39;s the place where inspiration and new ideas are born.

If the information isn&#39;t clear, I can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s relevant or fair. I want it simplified when possible - I don&#39;t want to work harder than is absolutely necessary. There&#39;s a lot vying for my attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it relevant?</strong> (necessary) This can depend on where I&#39;m headed and what I want to accomplish. It will change according to my agenda at the time. It&#39;s my job to keep this criteria in the front of my mind as I scan information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it fair?</strong> (kind) It&#39;s human nature to present information according to our personal biases, but I prefer to read and watch material offered from a balanced and thoughtful perspective. As a consumer, I&#39;d rather not have to sift through someone else&#39;s unfinished business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that the standards that most appeal to me can easily be paired with three of Sai Baba&#39;s prompts, and I can whole-heartedly echo, &quot;Is it an improvement over silence?&quot; <strong>In a world of stimulation and distraction, silence might be the ultimate competition.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are any number of standards to choose from and which standards we adopt is a personal preference. And, just in case you&#39;re wondering, the three standards I apply to the information I take in are the same three I use when writing my posts. I hope it makes for enjoyable reading. :-)</p>", "created": "2012-09-23T21:23:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:05:07.529Z", "slug": "gatekeepers"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 14, "fields": {"title": "From Scratch", "image": "journal/press.jpg", "tags": "create", "content": "<p>I&#39;ve got to tell you about my printer.

The list included stocking up on essentials, eating comfort foods (including homemade soup), snuggling pets, reading, not answering the phone, and adhering to established routines. Once safety was assured, coping tactics seemed to arrange themselves neatly around one core impulse - the instinct to draw in to ourselves - closer to home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When life is predictable and our equilibrium is not at stake, we can be careless.</strong> Self awareness and self monitoring loosen, and we tend to live our lives slightly beyond ourselves, in innocent and subtle preoccupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the status quo is called into question we <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/11/the-big-picture/\">make adjustments</a>.

(May I keep an open heart, even while noticing what is not open-hearted.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s teachings was to show us how to return to an awareness of the Love that we are, and the Love that connects us,</strong> so that we can enjoy our creative, learning process here on earth. His teachings were meant to <em>enable&nbsp;</em>us toward that goal - to open our eyes to the Truth about ourselves.Christ saw us through eyes of Love, not eyes that saw our imperfections and suffering.<strong>He did not see us as victims, but as sons and daughters of the Father - Divine Source.</strong><a href=\"http://www.tm.org/blog/enlightenment/kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/\">&quot;...the kingdom of God is within you.&quot; Luke 17:21</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think there&#39;s a misunderstanding about compassion. It seems that compassion has come to mean &quot;With an open heart, focus on, and identify with, the confusion and suffering of others.&quot; The way it was taught to me, if I didn&#39;t join the other in their suffering, I wasn&#39;t being compassionate. <strong>Christ&#39;s teaching to &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; was not an admonition to abandon our well-being for the sake of another, but a call to remember the truth about the Love we are. From that awareness of </strong><strong><em>powerful </em>Love, we are able to see clearly the needs <em>and the beauty&nbsp;</em>in the other, and respond in the most loving way.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of those who espouse and preach Christianity use it as a tool to judge and control others. Christ&#39;s words have been taught from pulpits raised above. This is the perspective created by systems assuming and misusing power - that they know better, and that we, the confused, suffering and imperfect, require their intervention to find our way. This is a lie. <strong>We already have the Love of which Christ spoke.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To know this Love, what&#39;s needed is for us to move beyond the beliefs that impede that knowing, including beliefs that cause our suffering, and those imposed by those in power.</strong> This is not easy - &quot;It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.&quot; - but the expereince of<em>powerfu&nbsp;</em>Love is available to each us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HUMILITY = accurate perception. Love is a very horizontal experience, no-one is above another.&nbsp;</strong>Knowing Love finds us in the correct relationship to Source. You cannot nuture the awareness of beauty and Love while <em>convinced</em> of another&#39;s imperfection, suffering, victimhood - basic &#39;wrongness&#39;. You can only nurture the beauty in another from an awareness of their beauty - and your own.<strong> Address any immediate &#39;need&#39; while,<em>at the same time,</em>remembering what&#39;s more True</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christ not only showed us the way, he created a path, as did Buddha and the other masters. <strong>They created a stream of Truth that will, if we open our hearts to it, return us to the awareness of Beauty and Love in ourselves.</strong> Theirthoughts, words and actions are the reference points that, if chosen, will produce enlightenment, a perception originating from the perspective of Source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merry, Merry Christmas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>", "created": "2012-12-09T01:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:12:31.845Z", "slug": "christ-and-love"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 20, "fields": {"title": "Women of the Wolves", "image": "journal/Warming_Up_for_the_Nights_Howl_Gray_Wolf-(1024x768).jpg", "tags": "empathy", "content": "<p>It&#39;s at times like this that I hold still.

In her book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Transformation-Beginning-Traditions/dp/0385721242\">The Great Transformation</a>, she brilliantly details the impetus&#39; for the world&#39;s four major religious traditions and does it in a way we can all relate to. Karen refers to the Axil Age, a pivotal time beginning in the ninth century BCE when sage teachings first took hold in primary, developed cultures. These sages are familiar to all of us - Isaiah, Confucius, Buddha, Socrates, and many more. With the passion and skill of an artisan, Karen reveals the players, the forces, the decisions and the beliefs that fueled the birth and blossoming of spiritual thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What she found might surprise you - <strong>spiritual focus and insight were provoked by the destructive forces of their day.</strong> &ldquo;All Axil Age faiths began in principled and visceral recoil from the unprecedented violence of their time. Despite some differences in emphasis, there was a remarkable consensus in their call for an abandonment of selfishness and a spirituality of compassion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find comfort in this broad, panoramic view. This isn&rsquo;t the first go-around. Mankind has lost perspective before - many times, apparently - and we have, with the help of poets, and wise <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/kimberlyawyatt/the-men-and-their-words/\" target=\"_blank\">men</a> and <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/kimberlyawyatt/the-women-and-their-words/\" target=\"_blank\">women</a>, found our way back to higher ground. <strong>It seems as though we need to fall apart on a semi-regular basis in order to remind ourselves about what&#39;s essential and what&#39;s optional.&nbsp;</strong>I suppose this falling apart, as painful as it may be, is a good thing, an opportunity to let go of old assumptions that no longer work&nbsp;and seek out deeper, fundamental truths.</p>", "created": "2013-01-27T10:44:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:19:27.811Z", "slug": "the-big-picture"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 24, "fields": {"title": "Tend and Befriend", "image": "journal/shutterstock_24065944.jpg", "tags": "choices", "content": "<p>You&rsquo;re late for your flight and a power-crazed TSA attendant pulls you aside for a lipgloss-nail-clipper-keychain baggage check.

They believe, when in danger, a woman will first consider the comfort and well-being of her child and tend to its needs.<strong> At a chemical level, the bonding hormone oxytocin reduces her fearfulness and lowers the typical fight-or-flight response.</strong>Another noted effect credited to oxytocin is the enhancement of social contact, which explains the second stress response more often shown by women - to connect with others, particularly women.Move over &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; and make room for <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/06/love-hormone/\">&ldquo;tend-and-befriend&rdquo;</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a former stressed-out single mother raising two daughters I can attest to this model. My girls will back me on this - my default stress responses were to clean and organize the house and/or call my sister and trade war stories. I have zero memories of a &lsquo;fight&rsquo; response and if I &lsquo;flew&rsquo;, it was to the safety of my home, where I started neatening.Tending and befriending is part of my chemical make-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m happy to say that I&#39;ve learned to deal differently with stress. When I get wound up these days, along with caring for others, I use my oxytocin totend and befriend myself. There&rsquo;s a lot I could say about this, so maybe I&#39;ll write about it <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/06/love-hormone/\">in another post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something to note: Taylor and the others are careful to say they aren&rsquo;t trying to assign stress responses to either gender. All of us can have all of them. Good. It&#39;s nice to know we have options. It helps keep the stress down...</p>", "created": "2013-02-03T18:08:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:21:30.676Z", "slug": "make-room-tend-and-befriend"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "Pray Love", "image": "journal/heart.gif", "tags": "love", "content": "<p>Sure, for some of us Valentines Day is a reminder that we don&#39;t have a special someone in our life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>when sadness opens wide the dark<br />\r\npray love into it<br />\r\nwhen emptiness pierces your heart<br />\r\npray love into it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>when aloneness is all there is<br />\r\npray love into it<br />\r\npray love into it<br />\r\n<strong>pray love into it all</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>every forgotten moment<br />\r\nevery lost hope<br />\r\nevery broken dream<br />\r\n<strong>pray love into it all</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big Love and hugs!</p>", "created": "2013-02-10T01:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:21:52.064Z", "slug": "pray-love-it"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 26, "fields": {"title": "The Love Hormone", "image": "journal/massage-bodyhand-01.jpg", "tags": "love", "content": "<p>Your smoke alarm goes off in the middle of the night.

I did &#39;hot&#39; yoga and enrolled in a class to become a massage therapist, giving and receiving at least 4 massages a week.

On specially designated days - Easter, Christmas, Hanukkah, Eid Al-Adha- we acknowledge this mystical realm. We approach the threshold between worlds and attempt to part the veil in order to glimpse the majesty beyond. We do this through ritual, prayer, art, myth, symbolism - and through metaphor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The life, death and resurrection of Christ is a metaphor I keep close to my heart. Of all the mysteries, the necessity of death seems to me the most mysterious.<strong> The story of Christ&#39;s life answers a deep forgetting and reminds me, &quot;That which is True can never really die.&quot; and, &quot;Let the death of &#39;what was&#39; be rich, fertile soil for &#39;what is yet to be&#39;.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, what about &#39;what is yet to be&#39;?

I began studying various spiritual traditions and practices, but found that even the most well-intended of them lacked the full, original, unadulterated insight that I needed. I attributed this to the natural devolution of Truth as it&#39;s translated from one generation to the next. The one answer they seemed unable to provided was the one answer I <em>had</em>to find - <strong>What is the relationship between my imperfect, physical body and my perfect, spiritual nature? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a visit to <em>Mount Madonna</em> (<a href=\"http://www.mountmadonna.org\">http://www.mountmadonna.org</a>/) in the Santa Cruz mountains, I got my first clue. Hindu teachings about yoga and our chakra systems speak to the inherent union between our physical bodies and our energy bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve deepened my search and my study, and what has evolved is a personal, intuitive practice of &lsquo;physical meditation&rsquo; that includes dance, aerobics, yoga, stretching and stillness. As I&rsquo;ve deepened these practices, I&rsquo;ve noticed inherent &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1- <strong>It brings me </strong><strong><em>into </em></strong><strong>my body</strong>, into my current moment, my physical experience. Muscles, breathing, movement, sweat. Good stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2- <strong>It requires a sustained discipline of attention on my inner world</strong>. Balance, intention, stretching, strength of will and determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3- <strong>It provides a physical metaphor for my spiritual states.</strong> When I dance, I&rsquo;m expressing my soul&rsquo;s joy. When I&rsquo;m doing yoga poses - the camel pose, child&rsquo;s pose or mountain pose - I&rsquo;m physically embodying the emotional states of open-heartedness, humility and strength. When I work out with a physio ball, I&rsquo;m acting out the experience of balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4- <strong>It teaches me to become aware of my energy and how I use it.</strong> Do I have enough? If not, why? Better sleep? Better nutrition? Better company? The energy that I <em>do</em> have, where is it going? When doing the Downward Facing Dog yoga pose, I&rsquo;m focused on my palms pressing into the mat, my heels touching down behind, and my tail lifting to the sky. I&rsquo;m paying attention. I&rsquo;m directing my energy. I&rsquo;m listening to my self in a whole new way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5 - <strong>Most importantly, what I&rsquo;ve learned through &lsquo;physical meditation&rsquo; is that my body is a gift</strong>, a vehicle to be celebrated, for it gives me <a href=\"/journal/2013/04/06/first-entry/\">the opportunity to experience and express</a> the truth of who I am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love and appreciate my body, and as I love it, so do I love my self.

Was thinking about Erin, about my girls when they were babies. I was so young - hadn&rsquo;t felt ready to be a mother - had not felt mothered myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d been reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537\">Steve Job&#39;s biography</a> and thought how he&rsquo;d been abandoned by his birth mother, hadn&#39;t been wanted. Remembered how I&#39;d felt unwanted and unloved. It is a theme - many of us feeling the absence of our mothers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began meditating on my loving, mother feelings, remembering Erin as a newborn. I imagined her small again and that I was holding her in my arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to go back, back to the times when the men in my life had put me down, had told my girls I wasn&rsquo;t loving. I wanted to go back and say &ldquo;I love my daughters. The error you see in me is the error you won&#39;t see as your own. Do <em>not</em> bring it here and hurt my child. I will protect them from you.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t do that then, but I could do it now - I have that power, that clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I went back in my heart, to that time, and I held my baby close and felt the sureness of my Mother Love. I meditated on my love for my daughters, let the Mother Love take me.Went to bed and had a dream...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m driving down a residential street in a old car. I suddenly swerve to the right to avoid hitting a woman lying in the street, wounded. I stop and jump out of the car and quickly go to her, cover her with my coat because she is naked. I think to get the denim quilt out of my car, but it isn&rsquo;t there, it&rsquo;s in the other car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I take the woman home, to one of the homes on the street. In her room is her baby. The baby has been hurt by the woman, by the things she didn&rsquo;t know. The baby is a newborn, but she is able to talk. She is saying that she knew, remembers the world before her birth. She knows she came with a purpose, even though she has been hurt. It is part of the plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to heal the baby. I pick her up and hold her little, naked body to my heart. I hope that the skin-to-skin comfort will heal the baby. I lie down on the bed and a Father Spirit covers us with a soft, quilted comforter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m lying on the bed and look up. I can see an angel above us, near the ceiling. The angel calls to me and I leave my body to join the angel. It feels so sweet to go to the angel. Just as I get there, someone, a man, comes into the room and my attention is brought back. I return to the bed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;While some who write in psychology today tout the leaving of the entire mother matrix as though it were a coup....in truth, the construct and concept of the wild mother can never and should never be abandoned.

He&rsquo;d answered his own questions about his potential as a leader, but wanted to know my thoughts on the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My response was part instinct, part hard-earned wisdom from my time directing a nonprofit, managing a large number of employees. &ldquo;A natural leader addresses something that seems obvious to them that isn&rsquo;t obvious to others. It&rsquo;s an organic process of recognizing a potential and inspiring people toward that improved vision. And, yes, some people, perhaps most people, need a leader. But there are also those who have figured out enough that they need minimal guidance. And then there are those who have their life so together that a leader would just get in their way.<strong> A true leader will know when they are necessary and when they are not.</strong>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With her book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947\">Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead</a></em>, Sheryl Sandberg has prompted a discussion about why there aren&rsquo;t more women in corporate and political leadership roles. As CEO of Facebook she&rsquo;s in the ideal position to start the dialogue. She proposes that women, particularly young women anticipating careers in a corporate setting, need to look within themselves to identify and overcome internal obstacles that keep them from aspiring to the top levels:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small by lacking self confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in. My argument is that getting rid of these internal barriers is critical to gaining power.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dialogue continued last week with Arianna Huffington&rsquo;s conference, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/third-metric\">The Third Metric: Redefining Success Beyond Money and Power</a>. Arianna highlights what has become obvious to so many - if a woman aspires to lead in the current corporate climate it will come at a high cost. For maximum effectiveness, she recommends we all &ldquo;lean back&rdquo; (like a cat ready jump!) before leaning in:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is a great moment for all of us - women and men - to acknowledge that the current male-dominated model of success isn&rsquo;t working for women, and it&rsquo;s not working for men either. The world needs women to redefine success beyond money and power.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is such a thing as natural leaders, like Sheryl and Arianna - smart, successful women using their advantaged perspectives to inspire us. And I believe there are many wise women who have yet to recognize this same ability within themselves, not only because they lack confidence or adequate sleep, but because they are limited to environments entrenched in masculine definitions. <strong>We need women to imagine options not currently being offered. What visions might we women lead toward if we were to disconnect from the masculine model, return to our bodies, become mindful, and imagine a life for ourselves and our world that&rsquo;s an expression of our highest conscience?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&rsquo;t help but mention one more observation that I&rsquo;ll write about more in another post. We refer to two environments, corporate and political, as the contexts within which leaders will be formed. I&rsquo;m noticing a third. <strong>Grass roots movements and crowd-driven phenomenon are now the children of the online world</strong> (think- TED, Kickstart, Feminie Power Global Community and Meetup.com).

The practitioner at the &quot;purgatorial fifth chakra&quot; is striving to clear their consciousness of the &quot;turbulence of secondary things&quot;. It is called &quot;Vishudda&quot;, which means &quot;purified&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The fifth chakra is about communication.

Less than loving beliefs and influences of the ego can, and do, distract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, this is &quot;the whole desire of the heart&quot;, and as we clear our consciousness of the beliefs, traditions and judgements that our ego would have us cling to - we are more able to join our will with God&#39;s Will and allow it&#39;s expression.

I wanted to wait until the choice became obvious, and it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It often happens that way - when I try to make a decision, a choice between &#39;this&#39; or &#39;that&#39;, and I can&#39;t sense the best way to go, rather than force myself, I wait.<strong> Invariably, if I ease off and give a little space and time, something will shift, either in me or in the circustances, and when I look again, the choice is obvious, compelling.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, not every decision can or should wait. Life has momentum, so I have other ways to approach decision making. The most important one I call &quot;listening&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It begins with the assumption that one of the choices, &#39;this&#39; or &#39;that&#39;, is <em>already </em>the better choice - the one that&#39;s closer to what I truly want. With &#39;listening&#39; I&#39;m just trying to discern which path that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, I ask.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ask myself, actually my <em>Self</em>, which option is closer to the Truth about me. <strong>Then I get quiet. I watch my thoughts. I sense my inner sensations. I suspend judgement and allow impressions to float up in my awareness. This is listening.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two, maybe three, options are before me. At some level, my inner wisdom <em>knows </em>which is best. Perhaps I just let my mind drift lightly over an imagined &#39;picture&#39; of each, and see which one my body&#39;s inner knowing responds to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does something &#39;click&#39; into place? Do my thoughts feel calm, simple and obvious? Do I feel a bubbly sensation rise up from my gut? Am I excited to take the fist steps?&nbsp;<strong>I&#39;ve had each of these be an indicator of which was the best choice, like the fog dispersed and the path lit up in front of me.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is inspiration, and I can follow this &#39;guidance&#39; with confidence and joyful anticipation.</p>", "created": "2014-02-16T01:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:33:45.864Z", "slug": "making-moves"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 41, "fields": {"title": "Emerson's Editor", "image": "journal/Margaret_Fuller_engraving.jpg", "tags": "choices", "content": "<p>If a great tree stands among other great trees in a forest, does it make a noise?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it does, we just have to listen more closely. Megan Marshall has attuned our ears in her biography<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Fuller-New-American-Life/dp/0547195605\"> <em>Margaret Fuller: A New American Life.</em></a> As I read this story I found it hard to believe I&#39;d never heard of this great woman, had never before been introduced to her insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarah Margaret Fuller, born May 23, 1810 in Cambridge Massachusetts, was the precocious eldest daughter of Timothy Fuller, a Harvard Law graduate and aspiring politician. Her intelligence and willingness were recognized early, and she effortlessly took on the potential of an eldest son, raised in her father&#39;s image. Her formal education, though priviledged, was restricted to private grammar school and academies for young women, which she completed by age 16. Other than this limited educational encouragement, Margaret was home-schooled and self-taught.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her father&#39;s aquaintances, as well as his ambitions, allowed Margaret access to the area&#39;s cultural leaders. Her friends were the artistic, philosophical and intellectual elete of the generation -<a href=\"http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm\"> Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, Henry David Thereau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Bronson Alcott, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even among this company, her accomplishments were exceptional: she created a salon, <em>Conversations</em>, intending to provoke women&#39;s intellects, and wrote the seminal feminist work, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_in_the_Nineteenth_Century\"><em>Women in the Nineteeth Century</em>.</a> As the first editor of Emerson&#39;s trascendentalist journal,<em>The Dial, </em>Margaret became known as one of the leaders in the Transcedentalist Movement. As a columnist for Horace Greeley&#39;s<em>New York Tribune, </em>she advocated for the poor, slaves and for women&#39;s rights, and by 1846 became the publication&#39;s first female editor. That same year she left for Europe and became our country&#39;s first female foreign correspondent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, as I witnessed the arch of her life, these notable accomplishments were not what impressed me most. What touched me, what sunk deep into the heart of me, was<strong> her ability to trascend the circumstances of her life, and of that day, to find a greater truth in her experience as a woman.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I recognize her instincts to seek out and study what was worthy, noble and honorable, and to hold these as her standard </strong>even though, as a woman, there was no cultural support for her in these efforts.<strong> I appreciate her courage and willfulness, her willingness to hold a position of tension between her aspirations and ideals, and the reality of the cultural barriers of that time. I honor her courage to acknowledge her hopes, even though doing so must have highlighted the painful truth - that she would never attain that which she could so clearly see.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to become aquainted with Margaret Fuller. She possessed a clarity of vision, thought and word that emanated from her life and transcended the definitions of her generation. Thank-you, Margaret, for asking, &quot;How is it that I seem to be this Margaret Fuller? What does it mean? What shall I do about it?&quot; . Thank-you for &quot;longing to experience life with (my) &#39;woman&#39;s heart&#39;&quot;. <strong>And thank-you for having an imagination that &quot;empower(ed) you to incessant acts of vigorous beauty.&quot;</strong></p>", "created": "2014-03-23T01:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-17T22:34:41.776Z", "slug": "margaret-fuller"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 42, "fields": {"title": "Get Bigger", "image": "journal/trusting.jpg", "tags": "listening", "content": "<p>Get Bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been simmering in me - the question.

Less fear getting in the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mistaken belief was that I was small, smaller than the context I found myself in, smaller that my family, my community, my church, the attitudes of the world toward me as a woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So many circles of influences, all insisting that I play myself down so that they could feel comfortable.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was nowhere for me to fit &#39;out there&#39;, so I went in.

We were made for these times. I have heard from so many recently who are deeply and properly bewildered. They are concerned about the state of affairs in our world now. Ours is a time of almost daily astonishment and often righteous rage over the latest degradations of what matters most to civilized, visionary people.</span></p><p>You are right in your assessments. The luster and hubris some have aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders, everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is breathtaking.<strong> Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. </strong>Especially do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were made for these times. Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement.</p><p>I grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never before in the history of humankind.</p><p>Look out over the prow; there are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. <strong>Even though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy roil, I assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless.</strong></p><p>In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is spending the wind without raising the sails.</p><p><strong>We are needed, that is all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know them when they appear.</strong> Didn't you say you were a believer? Didn't you say you pledged to listen to a voice greater? Didn't you ask for grace? Don't you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the voice greater?</p><p>Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. <strong>Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely.</strong> It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.</p><p>What is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. <strong>We know that it does not take everyone on Earth to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second,<em> or hundredth gale.</em></strong></p><p>One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul.<strong> Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. </strong>The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these &ndash; to be fierce and to show mercy toward others; both are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity.</p><p><span>Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do.</span></p><p>There will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it.<strong> I will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate.</strong></p><p>The reason is this: In my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. <strong>It is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here.

I trained with the Lymphoma &amp; Leukemia Society&rsquo;s Team in Training because I knew I was much more likely to go the distance if crossing the finish line meant benefitting another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot I could say about the lessons learned while training for an endurance event. I learned to discipline myself to a demanding schedule. I learned to eat and drink like an athlete. I learned to take <em>really good </em>care of my feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than that, I learned to listen to my body.</strong> I found my heart and breathing rates were the best way to assess my conditioning relative to stressors. I discovered my brain would start producing endorphins on each run at about the six mile mark when my mind would become clear and relaxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the scheduled distances increased to over 16 miles, the challenges became more mental than physical. My mindset evolved - &ldquo;How do I train<em> through</em> whatever might show up?&rdquo; - because I was committed to crossing the finish line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All valuable lessons. And, on the day of the run, I appreciated every one of them. But all of them pale in comparison to the lesson I learned the day of the marathon at mile 24.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mile 21 was &ldquo;the wall&rdquo; - when my body exhausted all it&#39;s chemical energy in the form of glycogen in the muscles and liver. I remember thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running on pure determination now.&quot;&nbsp;<strong>I was fueled exclusively by the energy of<em> will </em>from that time on, b</strong><strong>ecause there was simply nothing physical left to draw on.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At mile 22, my Dad joined&nbsp;me to run the last few miles - not clear, very fuzzy, something about the top of my head being very hot. Basically, delirium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then came mile 24.5. We were on a small rise on a road in Golden Gate park leading toward Kezar Stadium. I could just hear the band music playing at the finish line. I turned, spontaneously to my Dad, threw my arms in the air and chirped <strong>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we show what we&rsquo;re made of!&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had reached the &lsquo;zone&rsquo;, when all that was left was the next step&nbsp;and a sense of my Self I never knew I had - <strong>a Self that transcended whatever obstacles remained in my imagination. My awareness could not have been more potent or more present, because there was nothing else left</strong> - no past successes to refer to, no inflated ideas about the finish - just me, my Self, and the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All that training. All that effort and focus, and it wasn&rsquo;t about the finish line.</strong> Of course, if the finish line hadn&rsquo;t been the goal, I never would have discovered &lsquo;the moment&rsquo;, but finishing was a given. The actual gift was totally unexpected. <strong>The real gift was the unencumbered moment, the experience of finding out what I was truly made of.</strong></p>", "created": "2015-02-22T03:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-16T20:46:06.187Z", "slug": "what-were-made"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 55, "fields": {"title": "I Choose Better", "image": "journal/choices.jpg", "tags": "choices", "content": "<p>I almost gave up.

I could feel your sadness and your struggle to stay hopeful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;protective mother&rsquo; part of me wants to save you from this struggle. I want to say the right words, do just the right thing, or give you just the right book to help things become clearer to you. Part of me wants to gather everything I&rsquo;ve ever learned, take charge, and make everything better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All I want, all I&rsquo;ve ever wanted is for you to be safe, happy and free</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve told you before that when you came into my life it was my very first experience of loving someone unconditionally. Now I can look back on it and tell you how that changed my life completely, why it&rsquo;s so important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because what you brought with you, you courageous, amazing little woman, was the undeniable, powerful, truth - that you were Love in a tiny body - pure, innocent, trusting, unapologetic and shining. And I joined you in that love. I trusted it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I could see and feel God in you. It was so pure, so obvious. And that experience, that knowledge, became my compass and my barometer for measuring everything else that came my way. </strong>Following that Love has led me home to the Truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might not have seemed that way to you. The life I was living when you were born, and the beliefs I held about myself, were so far from love. My journey has been a long one, and I&rsquo;ve had to confront many deeply held, incorrect beliefs. You&rsquo;ve had the dubious honor of being part of my learning. I know it wasn&rsquo;t easy for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see you now on your journey. I see you - a determined, open-hearted, creative young woman with a dream of happiness for her life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see the perfect, pure being that you were when you first arrived for this adventure. You are still that being. <strong>You are God&rsquo;s own child, pure Love, pure innocence. If I could give you anything, it would be the memory of this truth about yourself.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is what is most true. It is what I see when I see you through the eyes of my heart. It is what I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the circumstances that surround you may seem overwhelming, may convince you otherwise, ignore them. You are not a victim. You are a powerful, free creator. <strong>You are included fully in God&rsquo;s Love, and any belief, person, organization or memory that even hints otherwise is a lie.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than that, the Truth about you doesn&rsquo;t live in any outward condition or circumstance. It lives deep within you. <strong>Pure beauty and Love live quietly, in the shelter of your heart.</strong> This pure beauty will burn away the lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spend time there. Remember with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where I hold you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom</p>", "created": "2015-05-10T03:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-16T20:43:05.561Z", "slug": "dear-daughter"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 57, "fields": {"title": "Dear Mr. President", "image": "journal/Barack 5.jpg", "tags": "empathy", "content": "<p>Dear Mr. President,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I listened to your <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_614_-_the_president_was_here\">Marc Maron podcast</a> the other day. Thank-you for making yourself accessible, for the chance to experience you in a person-to-person, man-cave-garage dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I read your book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dreams-My-Father-Story-Inheritance/dp/1400082773\">Dreams from My Father</a></em> several years ago, it touched me to listen to you shed light on some of the decisions that went into organizing your life. &ldquo;Trying on different outfits&rdquo;, returning to core values such as honesty and kindness, and forgiving ourselves, are life activities that ring true to many of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also appreciated hearing your reasoning and discussion about issues surrounding gun safety laws and race relations. Your efforts to break out of old political patterns and connect with the latent decency within the American people was not lost on me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now its easy for me to imagine you in my own living room. And we&#39;re having a great conversation over tea. I don&#39;t know if you drink tea, or if you can only drink out of unopened water bottles, but protocols and formalities have been dismissed (no disrespect intended). Because, in my imagination we&#39;re already in mid-conversation, talking about things that matter and the beautiful truths that form the foundation of our country&#39;s belief system and what they mean to the people you lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can imagine that you might listen to what I have to say, and so I&#39;m telling you about my experience working with high-need families in northern California. The non-profit I directed had amazing success reducing the number of children in group homes using a strengths-based model called <a href=\"http://nwi.pdx.edu/\">Wraparound</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It worked because we were able to get around some of the prohibitive structures by blending funding streams from several sources, including State, Federal, CPS, Juvenile Justice and Children&#39;s Mental Health. More importantly, it worked because the &#39;treatment&#39; approach was community-based, and <strong>grounded in the assumption that every person we served was innately valuable and in possession of unique strengths. Goodness<em>can</em> be operationalized.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank-you for using words like &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;love&quot; when discussing what&#39;s effective in improving the lives of less advantaged children. <strong>The power within a loving intent is beyond our ability to measure. In our outcome-driven culture we too often undervalue and underestimate the potential effects of pure goodness.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve often wondered how it was we lost a sense of reverence for our humanity. Lincoln referred to the &ldquo;better angels of our nature&quot; and that makes me smile. <strong>It means there was a time when the president of our country could refer to &ldquo;angels&quot; and &ldquo;our nature&rdquo; in the same sentence, and assume a common understanding with his audience.</strong> Personally, I think he was on to something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So much more I could say, but that&#39;s enough for now. Again, thank-you for inspiring meaningful dialogue. It&#39;s been great &#39;talking&#39; to you, if only in my imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wish you every good thing.

I&#39;d left him a year ago, but he&#39;d come to find me, weak on the left side of his body and struggling to produce full sentences. He was in real trouble, and I had a decision to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Forgiven</em> is a letter to my daughters chronicling the events that facilitated the unfolding of my spiritual understanding. It&#39;s an account of my departure from the cloistered culture of the Mormon church and my quest for freedom from my family&#39;s generational wounds. It&#39;s an exposition of the soulless systems I encountered as a naive, single mother, and my attempts to negotiate them with integrity. It&#39;s a story about my love relationships with my daughters, my twin sister and my husband Al, and about the life-changing opportunity he offered me. Ultimately, it&#39;s a love story celebrating the challenges and choices that lead me to experience the truth about myself and a reunion with my God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness is the act of acknowledging and referencing the connective tissue of mystical union, an act of faith that stands witness to the body of our commonly held consciousness. When we choose to forgive another, we claim our identity as God&#39;s offspring and call to our experience the gifts of heaven, gifts that heal and inform us. In God&#39;s eyes we already exist in perfect, loving union. When we forgive we access this truth directly, weakening the grip of our ego and bringing our true identity closer to our conscious awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My ability to forgive forms the bridge that lifts me from the confusion and pain of a conflicted world, to peace and communion with God. As I&#39;ve turned my mind and heart, choice by choice, toward the God within me and a love that includes, my perception has expanded. The practice of forgiveness exposes my true identity, thinning my attachment to judgement and separation, and deepening my relationship with unifying love, grace and guidance. My identity evolves from ideas <em>about</em> my self to a state of <em>being </em>my<em> </em>Self; from, &quot;Oh, now I <em>get</em> it!&quot; to, &quot;Oh, now I&#39;m <em>being</em> it!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new identity can&#39;t be comprehended, only practiced. It&#39;s a stance of willingness toward God, a state of openness, non-judgment and humility. We ask what our soul needs to ask, then listen, forgiving whatever may get in the way. We then rest in quiet certainty, listening once again. With the practices of forgiving and listening we come to know Inclusive Love as our context and our true nature, experiencing others, and ourselves, as <em>forgiven</em>.</p>", "created": "2015-08-23T03:00:00Z", "modified": "2016-11-16T20:39:12.891Z", "slug": "forgiven"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 60, "fields": {"title": "Keep Singing", "image": "journal/airplane_3MO7zQs.jpg", "tags": "empathy", "content": "<p>It seems to happen to me at 30,000 feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time it was a Frontier flight from Chicago to Portland.

He traded down and the fateful transplant from row 25 made himself comfortable on my left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a rule, when I travel I visually greet whoever&#39;s next to me and assess their boundaries, particularly on longer flights. I want to get a sense of how careful I&#39;ll need to be with my elbows. The young man buckling the seatbelt next to me was appropriately engaging, polite, happy to have moved closer to the exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t know exactly what allows the shift. It could be the absence of time as a reference point once the craft escapes the earth&#39;s pull and magically transcends the cloud cover. It could be that the loss of physical freedom causes a general sense of immediacy and intimacy. Whatever it is, at 30,000 feet I&#39;m able to forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What were you doing in Chicago?&quot; &quot;A workshop.&quot; &quot;A relative&#39;s graduation.&quot; I don&#39;t remember who asked first, but with the initial pleasantries exchanged, and his gentle openness noted, I was free to relax. &quot;Do these seats not recline or is mine stuck?&quot; &quot;Can you see that light in the west?&quot; &quot;I was noticing the city below us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were chasing the setting sun and dusk shone neon orange atop the horizon of clouds. Beautiful, shining. I&#39;d never seen it before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you like music?&quot; My accidental companion handed me one of the ear buds from his headphones. &quot;No. It goes in the left ear.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We listened to his play list for almost four hours; pop songs I knew, some that I didn&#39;t, songs from his home in an exotic language. &quot;I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t understand the words because then I listen to the music differently.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&#39;t the headphone sharing that touched me. (Is that a thing now?) It wasn&#39;t that he let me pick the songs or that he bought me a cranberry apple drink (really, Frontier?) It was that he knew the words to the songs and sang along to every one. With me just a few inches from him, he sang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We exchanged phone numbers in front of baggage claim. He came to visit the other evening and the man who arrived at my home wasn&#39;t the same man I&#39;d met in row nine. He was distracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It happens when the plane touches down. Along with greeting the ground, we greet our lives as we know them; remember our schedules, our commitments, our ideas about who we are and who we think others are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m glad for the ground. I live here too. Yet, if I could, I&#39;d tell the man my secret - that the larger part of me is still at 30,000 feet, where time and judgements are suspended, the sunlight glows orange above the clouds, and a soft voice sings gently and fearlessly in my ear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d tell him it&#39;s alright to keep your commitments and to hold onto your ideas about life.

Please don&#39;t believe yourself so far from me that you deny this. I&rsquo;ve been where you are now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know how it feels to believe that love has betrayed you. I have visited the despair of &quot;there is no love&quot; repeatedly as I&#39;ve looked for evidence of it in my world. I&#39;ve longed for a smile of approval from our mother, a nod of confidence from our father, a gesture of inclusion from any one of my siblings. I&#39;ve searched for it in the eyes of my daughters, in the desperate hope that their forgiving hearts would find me innocent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve looked for it in the approval of men who needed someone to be &#39;wrong&#39; and powerless so they could know themselves &#39;right&#39; and powerful. In countless ways I contorted and betrayed my Self, conforming to another&#39;s&nbsp;model of reality so I might feel the small comfort of usefulness, and called&nbsp;it love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve looked for it in identifying with the righteousness of the &#39;victim&#39; experience. Nothing can feel more exonerating than the ability to clearly describe an abuse, assign blame and attack an offender. In the absence of real love, this can be a very seductive option, one that offers the illusion of power and safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve looked for love in all the places one could hope to find it, believing it lived in the hearts of others and that I just needed to find the right &#39;other&#39; and elicit it. I thought love came from somewhere outside of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been there and I understand it, but know that expecting another person&#39;s attention and compassion to heal the disconnect any of us feels from Love is backwards thinking. Love is available to us, always, as children of God&#39;s Love. It is the energy of extension, and is continually being extended to us from Infinite Loving Souce. When we accept it and align with it, <em>and extend it to others</em>, we know peace, certainty and comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do the most good as we ignore the&nbsp;fearful madness and forgive the errors of thought that deny the Love that we all Are. The Truth is still true. There is no greater power. Every other &#39;power&#39; is a &quot;puff of madness&quot; in the face of Infinite Love. God has never stopped loving us, sees only the perfection and innocence in us, has already forgiven everything....never thought there was anything needing forgiving. Nothing changes this. Nothing<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love and peace are available, but only you can learn to receive them&nbsp;for yourself. Aligning with Infinite Loving Source&nbsp;isn&#39;t something someone&nbsp;else can do for you. You alone&nbsp;are responsible for your choice&nbsp;to return to this awareness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Truth is in the quiet. When you stop controlling, stop assigning blame to others, stop judging yourself, and hand the outcome over to One Who has the bigger picture, Love will be easier to know. Absolute acceptance and peace is very, very big. Go to that place and stay there. Don&#39;t leave it for anything or anyone. Period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how I love you. I love you by holding in my heart the absolute belief in Who you are. I hold the Truth about you in my awareness and remain unconvinced that there is any other truth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet me at Love,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your sister, always.</p>", "created": "2016-01-01T00:02:10Z", "modified": "2016-11-24T00:19:24.193Z", "slug": "a-good-listener"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 65, "fields": {"title": "Ownership", "image": "journal/ownership.jpg", "tags": "forgiveness", "content": "<p>From my journal 1/24/2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dream....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young women has created something new. She&#39;s taken unworked lengths of wood and formed them into a unique shape with a trough down the middle. This design makes the wood very useful. She shows it to her powerful male friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She and I go to visit this friend and he&rsquo;s taken the young women&#39;s brilliant idea and made his own wood pieces. She tells him they aren&#39;t the same as hers. She pinches the lip of his pieces and the wood breaks off between her fingers - a cheap copy. He intends to market the wood as his idea. The young woman is angry and hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three of us are walking on the beach, back to the woman&#39;s workshop. A wave rises up and engulfs the young woman.&nbsp;She&rsquo;s lost in the curl of the wave. The wave deposits her on the beach close to the water&rsquo;s edge. She can&rsquo;t move. She&rsquo;s too beat up. I take her arm and try to drag her to safety. Before I can, another wave comes and takes her. Again, she is ravaged by the wave and then laid out on the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I take her arms quickly and drag her to a spot some distance from the water. The man still doesn&rsquo;t understand that he&rsquo;s hurt the young woman. He just doesn&rsquo;t get it. I go to him, pounding on his chest, trying to get him to see. He goes to the young woman and picks her up. She&rsquo;s still unconscious and is limp in his arms. He carries her to the path (leading back to her workshop). He wants to do right by her but doesn&rsquo;t know how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see it. I see the misunderstanding between the young woman and the powerful man. I see it with my whole heart and the pain of it hits me. It&rsquo;s so much pain I can&rsquo;t stay standing. I hit the ground on my bended knees, my head to the ground. My body is compressed with the weight of the sadness that&rsquo;s within me and pressing down all around me. I&rsquo;m sad beyond words, seeing what is missing, wanting the man to see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crushing sadness is the realization of a belief system that allows the powerful man to assume entitlement to the beauty and goodness of the young woman. I wake up knowing that it&rsquo;s a sadness too big to be held in a conscious state, the sadness of the misjudged, misunderstood and misused woman. The sadness for the &quot;powerful&quot; man who can&#39;t find his own connection to Creation.</p>", "created": "2016-01-25T00:25:41Z", "modified": "2016-11-24T00:33:05.462Z", "slug": "ownership"}}, {"model": "journal.post", "pk": 66, "fields": {"title": "Identity", "image": "journal/Sedona_004.jpg", "tags": "choices", "content": "<p>From my journal 2/7/2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a woman raised in a patriarchal system I was taught to obey the authority of men who had a misunderstanding about&nbsp;Love.

We were a family of eight back then since your aunt Trina hadn&rsquo;t been born. We must have filled every chair in our small family room as my father taught a lesson about strengthening the family through obedience to church principles. The evening would have included a prayer, a song and a special treat from mother, usually cookies.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mother was a seamless garment, moving from room to room, from child to child, from one guiding principle to another with fluid intent. She was the perpetually preoccupied center around which our world rotated, and her word was law.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember this Monday night in particular because Mother had proposed an extraordinary idea. &ldquo;Since your father is so busy he doesn&rsquo;t get to spend tome alone with each of you, we&rsquo;ve got a special plan. Starting next week Dad is going to take you, one at a time, on a special dinner just the two of you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing in our home was more valuable, more reverenced, than our father&rsquo;s attention.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Connie will go first and then each of you will take your turn.&rdquo; Oldest to youngest was the usual arrangement for dispensing anything in scarce supply.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always last!&rdquo; I asserted.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re the youngest,&rdquo; Connie reminded me.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; I persisted.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In an uncommon display of leniency, my mother softened. &ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t fair that Ardyn is always last, so we&rsquo;ll draw straws.&rdquo; Drawing straws was Mother&rsquo;s system for randomly assigning Saturday chores. It made everything fair. She went to the broom closet and returned with six straws extended from the palm of her hand.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each of us pulled a straw with a sense of anticipation you&rsquo;d expect to see at the birth of a child. My older siblings held up their straws of varying lengths for everyone to compare. I did the same, holding my stub up next to the others. I&rsquo;d drawn the shortest straw.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A concert of collective laughter poured over me, the joyless sound of those on familiar terms with shame. My cheeks burned and an overwhelming wave of numbness took over, distancing me from the unbearable experience of being the butt of my family&rsquo;s joke.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, Ardyn, it was fair.&rdquo; My mother&rsquo;s voice cut through the frenzy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bed time for all of you now.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aunt Kathryn and I had twin beds in a room at the end of the hall. Mother gave us each a peck on the forehead and the room fell silent. In the quiet I felt my covers move, lifted back, and then a nudge. Wordlessly Kath pulled herself next to me on the bed. Her head on my pillow, I stretched my arm over and around her, my legs fitting into the back of her knees. Kath and I fell asleep together like spoons.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I remembered the story this time it was me with my arm around Kath, but I could just as easily remember it the other way around. At any given time, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you who was holding onto who, and it hardly matters. When we were alone, away from the competitive influences of a family trying to prove itself, Kath and I held onto each other. The unspoken assumption was love, love big enough to include both of us.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>", "created": "2016-09-29T03:09:16Z", "modified": "2016-11-28T04:21:49.699Z", "slug": "the-shortest-straw"}}]
